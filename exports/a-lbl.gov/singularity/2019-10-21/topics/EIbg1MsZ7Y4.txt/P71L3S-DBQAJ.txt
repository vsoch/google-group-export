Hi Carlos,

Is it possible to give snakemake an argument to use a specified directory
instead of .snakemake? If so, you could point it to use /tmp/.snakemake and
it should work as expected. If not, I would try bind mounting an empty
directory from the host into the container at the expected location of the
.snakemake directory. Let me know if either of those solutions work for
you.

Cheers,
Michael

I have noticed an odd problem when combining Snakemake workflows inside
Singularity containers. By default Snakemake will not re-run files that it
has already completed, so in the event that the workflow ends abruptly or a
new sample file is added to an existing directory of samples, only the
samples that have not been run through the complete pipeline or the new
samples are run. However, this does not happen when you run a Snakemake
workflow inside a Singularity container. It runs every single through every
single rule regardless of whether it already exists or not. My assumption
is because Snakemake relies on a .snakemake directory that it creates that
has information on the various temp files it has for every sample and that
doesn't exist within Singularity.

Any idea on how you can get around this? It's not a use-case that happens
very often, but we have run into the issue where the pipeline hangs when
running a huge amount of samples, and we have to restart the entire process
instead of only finishing up what wasn't complete.

Thanks!
