Subject: Default cache directory vote

Hi everyone, I need some opinions and votes. Read on, and cast your vote
and thoughts in a reply!

I am juggling in my head where to put the default Singularity cache
directory. This is the directory where Singularity containers are put when
someone invokes the command "singularity install file.sapp". The two
options that I am juggling between are:

1. $HOME/.sapp-cache: This is nice because it always exists and permissions
are always allowed for this user to write in. But considering it will have
things like bind mounts present and if it is mounted over NFS with
root_squash enabled, certain processes along the Singularity execution path
will fail (as we saw with Chris last month), this location is not perfect
but it does seem to be the expected behavior.

2. /var/singularity/$USERNAME: /var is historically a place where non-root
(as well as root) owned files exist (e.g. mail and printer spooling,
logging, etc..) and because it is root owned, this means every user that
wants to install Singularity containers/apps must obtain root's permission
in the form of creation of a directory here. On the plus side, this space
can then be file system tuned for Singularity if desired, and shared
accordingly via NFS. For these reasons, this with appropriate documentation
and helper/warning messages is my preference.

Also it is possible to override whatever directory is chosen via an
environment variable, so this decision only affects the default behavior.

Please let me know what you think!
