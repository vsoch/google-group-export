Subject: Singularity 1.0 released

It is with great pleasure that I announce the first release of Singularity!

Singularity is a container platform built around the notion of "Mobility of
Compute". With Singularity you can build executable containers based on
your host system and define what happens when that container is launched.
Processes inside the container can be single binaries, or a complex of
binaries, scripts and data.

While there are several full featured container systems that already exist,
these container solutions are feature rich as they tend to emulate a full
hardware virtualization hypervisor. Because of many of these features (e.g.
user level contexts and ability to escalate to root) implementation on
large scale multi-user resources is difficult and maybe impossible. This is
what motivated the development of Singularity; a lightweight, non-invasive
and easily implementable container system that supports existing workflows
and focuses on application portability and mobility.

In this release, you can expect the following support:

* Ability to create Singularity containers based on a package specfile
* Specfile templates can be generated automatically (singularity specgen
...)
* Support for various automatic dependency resolution
   * Dynamic libraries
   * Perl scripts and modules
   * Python scripts and modules
   * R scripts and modules
   * Basic X11 support
   * Open MPI (v2.1 - which is not yet released)
* Direct execution of Singularity containers (e.g. ./container.sapp [opts])
* Access to files in your home directory and a scratch directory
* Existing IO (pipes, stdio, stderr, and stdin) all maintained through
container
* Singularity internal container cache management
* Standard networking access (exactly as it does on the host)
* Singularity containers run within existing resource contexts (CGroups and
ulimits are maintained)
* Easily integrated into existing schedulers and batch scripts
* Support for scalable execution of MPI parallel jobs
* Singularity containers are portable between Linux distributions
