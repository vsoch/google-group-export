 still a version mismatch between the drivers installed on the image and on=
 the host. If you are sure that is not true, it may be possible that the ve=
rsion of the driver that is installed on the machine isn&#39;t new enough f=
or the GPU. That actually occurred on our cluster, and after a sysadmin upd=
ated the driver, it worked. Barring that I am not too sure. Maybe if you pr=

able to think about something, but my suspicion is that the driver version =
