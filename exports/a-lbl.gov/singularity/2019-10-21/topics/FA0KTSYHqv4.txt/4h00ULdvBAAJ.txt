I'm no longer surprised by anything around the now-meaningless term
"open source".  However, it's odd to be attacked for contributing to a
project under its permissive free software licence (which I wouldn't
choose) rather than balkanizing effort.  Especially so in defence of
something without a licence to make it usable, despite containing some
of my code.  What on earth is the objection to LBL branding, to the
extent there is any?

If Greg doesn't want a contribution, he doesn't have to put it into the
Singularity repo in an appropriate way (or get me to integrate it).
Anyhow what I posted is tolerably robust and, I think, a reasonable
basis for improvement.  It actually works with Docker images I have,
including ones with Size 0, doesn't leak containers, and doesn't delete
anything in cwd.  If it's not wanted for Singularity, I'll maintain it
separately.  If someone has something better, please share it.
