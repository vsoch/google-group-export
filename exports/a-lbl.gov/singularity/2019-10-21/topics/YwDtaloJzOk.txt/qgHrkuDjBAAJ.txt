Hi,

I have a - possibly unusual - workflow in mind for which I'm wondering 
how to best implement it. The basic idea is as follows:

 From an often-modified git source folder, a user wants to run an 
experiment. This experiment should be extremely reproducible, and I'd 
like to store the corresponding data for a long time.

For this, the current workflow looks like this: On starting such an 
experiment, a new folder is created containing
- start script: Clones the git origin, checks out the commit and applies 
the diff to reproduce the original code exactly. Also creates a folder 
for the results and for checkpoints, and starts singularity, binds 
everything, etc.
- diff-file: simply git diff.
- parameter definition: To verbosely set parameters
- image definition: Defining the image properties


Now, this structure has the advantage of allowing storage of hundreds of 
experiments, since each is only a few kB in size. However, to actually 
make it work five years from now, the image definition is extremely 
important.

Clearly, the best way to do that (and this is what singularity suggests) 
is to store the built image. This will absolutely allow us to reproduce 
anything (except for changes in singularity versions, but let's ignore 
that for now). However, that would force us to either symlink images in 
there (which means that changing the original image might invalidate 
hundreds of images) or to copy images (which means that we'll have to 
deal with a few GB of image per folder). Both are therefore not really 
usable.

The alternative is to check the bootstrap script using singularity 
inspect -d and store that. Clearly, it also has disadvantages: I have to 
force my users to define everything in the launch script (and never use 
-w) and the install commands will soon be obsolete unless specifying 
exact versions. And even then, any outside changes will make that 
unreliable.

For now, I'm just assuming that the installed packages plus the date 
will allow a user to reconstruct a package version a few years from now 
with an acceptable amount of work. That's clearly not optimal, but seems 
the best way to do it.


Or are there alternatives I haven't noticed? Might a locally-hosted shub 
be part of the solution? Any other ideas?

Thanks!

Frederik
