I'm not totally sure what you are asking (what is "previous version" and
"that's" referring to?), but I'll provide some clarifying points, if it
helps.

- the user should be immediately able to understand the similarities and
differences between any two containers. Yes, this means containers with the
same functionality but different OS... we can't deduce every possible
situation (for example, error debugging) that this might be useful for, but
it is a basic function that will be useful.
- what is mostly interesting for a single container is not the base OS.
This is why the basic operation to "tag" an image with installed software
should look like this:

      - use basic machine learning to classify the base OS of a container
(or if we make it, just look at the spec file)
      - subtract this base set of software (files and folder paths) from
the image to find the difference
     - - the difference is the interesting part!

So in context of two images with different OS but equivalent software, we
should still be able to subtract the appropriate base OS from each, and
then the equivalent software cancel out, and then determine they are highly
similar.

Hope that helps!
