Subject: Re: [Singularity] kernel panic after editing in sandbox

You might use overlayfs for data for example.  Then your squashfs image
would contain your application(s) (with dependencies, environment, etc.)
and your ext3 image would contain your data that could change whenever your
ran the squashfs container.  That's one potential use case that does not
include debugging a container as you build it.  But in many situations you
can accomplish something similar by bind mounting a directory into the
container and keeping your data there.

As to your second question, an ephemeral overlayfs is created and mounted
for you by default when you use a container in Singularity 2.4.  That is
how you are able to make changes to your container that don't persist
across uses.  This happens for everyone, not just root users.  So if there
is some kernel bug that is crashing nodes when an overlayfs is altered, I
would image a non-root user could tickle the bug and cause a crash just
like a root user.  I would definitely err on the side of safety and edit
the singularity.conf.  I would then double check by attempting to crash a
new node with the same series of commands that crashed the previous one.
