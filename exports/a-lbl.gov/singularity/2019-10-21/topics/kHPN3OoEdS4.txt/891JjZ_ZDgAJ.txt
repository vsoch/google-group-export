Hi,

I'm currently testing singularity for running slc6 based software on Ubuntu 
machines, which works remarkably well so far! However, from what I've 
gathered in the various documentations and examples I'm led to believe that 
I should be able to find "singularity.conf" within my singularity image in

/etc/singularity/

This is not the case for the image I've build. The conf was introduced with 
2.1 if I read other threads correctly so using the master branch (what I'm 
doing) should have this as well, right?
I've also tried to include singularity.conf by hand, but it doesn't seem to 
be used. I'm probably just missing something but reading the documentation 
I get the impression that the conf should be there without any further 
steps to take from my side. One thing I noticed is that the instructions 
here

http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-config

claim that I should find the file in 
"$SYSCONFDIR/singularity/singularity.conf". SYSCONFDIR is not defined in my 
image environment, but a quick env scan gives me this

SINGULARITY_sysconfdir=/etc

I guess that's only documentation being behind the evolution of the code.

For reference, I'm bootstrapping the image from the cern slc6 docker 
registry (defintion file is attached), but I also don't see the 
singularity.conf when I just try the example here:

http://singularity.lbl.gov/singularity-tutorial#create-a-reproducible-image

Thanks in advance for your help and thanks in general for this great tool!

Cheers,

Thomas
