Let me echo Daniel's idea.  The directory inside the container does not
need to be named the same as the directory that you are binding to on the
host system.  So it doesn't matter if you don't know the name of the shared
directory at build time.  You could just create a directory called "/share"
or something and bind there.  Or if you are using a base image that has a
directory like /mnt you could just bind there.

As for the command line, you can always set the SINGULARITY_BINDPATH
environment variable.  That keeps your command line nice and clean.

Dave
