Hi Martin,

Github permissions are based on the level of the repository, which can be
owned by an individual or an organization. When a user logs into
Singularity Hub with a Github account, they do so with a user name and not
an organization, as it could be that different users in an organization
have different read/write permissions to different repositories. Then
Singularity Hub is able to "see" whatever repositories pass through that
filter.

For those user's to contribute under the same umbrella, you simply need to
give them read/write access to the repos in the organization. When they log
in, they will be able to see the repos for which is the case. When you give
access to Singularity Hub, you are *only* granting permission to
Singularity Hub to see those repos. You are not giving access to all third
party apps - you would still need to give permission to each other
application that might ask for it. To be completely transparent, the only
thing we do to make the guts work is generate a webhook that pings
Singularity Hub whenever someone pushes.

My suggestion would be that you create the organization, give Singularity
Hub access to the repos that are needed, and then add everyone in your
institution as members. They don't even need to manage the Singulairty Hub
side - once one user has "hooked up" a repository then anyone that pushes
to it will trigger the build. I also recommend, given that you are having
many people contribute to repos, that you stick to the traditional flow of:

1. Master branch lives with main organization repository
2. Members of the organization fork to their accounts
3. Updates are added to feature branches, and a PR done to the master in
the organization when ready for review
4. **only commit to master in the organization after this process!

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm really glad you are making
an organization to work together on containers! As soon as 2.3 is out we
will be able to update the Hub builders too :)

Best,

Vanessa
