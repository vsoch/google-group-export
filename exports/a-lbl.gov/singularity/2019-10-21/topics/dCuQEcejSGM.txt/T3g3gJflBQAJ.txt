I'm not sure if this is what you are trying to do or not, but you might try
using Docker Hub.  Once you are finished building your Docker Container to
your liking, you can push the image to a registry on Docker Hub.  Then you
can use the `pull` command (new in Singularity 2.3!) to download the layers
of your Docker image and convert them to a Singularity container.  Or if
your are using Singularity 2.2 you can create a definition file based on
the docker definition file.  Then you would use the `bootstrap` command to
create your container.  Is that what you are shooting for?
