Folks:

I am building a container that I'd like a bit of feedback on.  Here are the 
issues:

1) I want the container to be public.
2) The container contains a piece of commercial software that, if it has a 
license file, will operate without restriction.
3) The license file needs to be in a specific location within the app's 
install directory (e.g. ~/myapp/license_folder/license.txt)

Obviously, I don't want to include the license file in the singularity 
container.  So, I'm asking what might be the best practice.  My thought was 
for the user to set an environment variable 
("MY_LICENSE_FILE=/path/to/local/license") that the singularity container, 
if it finds, dynamically creates a symlink to at runtime.  Is this the 
right approach?  If so (or if not), how would I do this?
