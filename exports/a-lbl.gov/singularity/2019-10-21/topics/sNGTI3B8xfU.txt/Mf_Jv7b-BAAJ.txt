This is a great idea, and the reason that we added the "From" command (akin
to docker). For example, right now you can bootstrap from a Docker image:

Boostrap: Docker
From: ubuntu:latest

etc.

In the case you showed, your "inherit" is simply a renaming of "From" - and
I (think) we either have something in the queue, or have talked about the
idea of image "overlays" before. It sounds like to achieve the
functionality you are describing, given that we have another Singularity
definition, we would do something like:

Bootstrap: Singularity
From: myimage/latest

etc.

My overall 0.02 - let's focus on doing the current functionality really
well, without bugs, before we try to expand it too quickly. A lot of what
we are talking about will be greatly helped with a singularity equivalent
of Docker Hub, and this is still in development. Some more comments below!

This makes sense.

We would want to explicitly walk people through different goals and use
cases...

I never thought about the idea of allowing for multiple inherits (From) in
one file, I'm interested to hear what others think about this. My instinct
is telling me if would lead to a lot more bugs, given that three different
things are going into one image generation (what if one image has a bug?
What if one software is reinstalled? not compatible? etc). There is
something to be said for maintaining the standard that is known, the one
that Docker has been using, but I'd be open to support for the other way.

This also sounds messy. I like the idea of having "modules" that could be
added to the post section (so the same code isn't done over a million
times) but I'm not sure how this would work easily - some kind of template
library? Then if the template changes, it's another thing to keep track of
second to the image and it's spec. No, I don't like this idea.
