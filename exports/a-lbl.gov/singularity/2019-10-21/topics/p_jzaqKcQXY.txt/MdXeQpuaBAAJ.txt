I'm thinking for some reason, that even with the --installroot file,
that it's pulling in the hosts /etc/yum.conf and *not* using the
$SINGULARITY_BUILD_ROOT/etc/yum.conf ... and so, as in my case, it's
trying to pull the packages from the Sci Linux 7 repo instead of the
SL6 repo that the image is.
