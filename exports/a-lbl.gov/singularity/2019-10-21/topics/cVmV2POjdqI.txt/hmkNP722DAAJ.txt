No, I don't want singularity to run in a Docker container. I want to use a 
Docker container to install all the build dependencies (go, git, etc) but 
then just move the built binaries and necessary directories over to the 
host where singularity will run.

It is working now. So at least this is possible in concept. Go is therefore 
only a requirement at build from source time.
