It's Debian 8.5
Just to give you some background information that could be of relevance:

Our cluster is a secure environment that sensitive information. (
http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/sensitive-data/use-tsd/index.html
)
What means that we don't have an internet connection and we're not allowed
to ssh into the cluster. I think it's because norwegian law requires
2 factor authentication into the server. So, when I work on the cluster
it's via thinlinc.
It might be that all forms of screen forwarding are disabled by the admins.
I'm not sure.
