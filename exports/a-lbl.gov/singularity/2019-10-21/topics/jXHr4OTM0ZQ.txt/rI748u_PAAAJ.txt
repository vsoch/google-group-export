Well, on production systems, it is normal that some users are given sudo
privs to run a few commands like dmidecode, cache-flushing script, some
GPFS commands (many can only be run by root). In such cases there is no
worry that these commands would destroy the NFS. But for the singularity
case, being given sudo privs to the singularity command is almost the same
as being given the root password.

Hmmm, big challenge!
