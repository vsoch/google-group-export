Is the sbatch installed on a filesystem that is different from where you
are working? You might need to do something like bind the location
directly. Let's say it's in /share/peanuts then try doing:

singularity shell --bind /share/peanuts/bin:/opt container.simg

and then make sure the opt/ path with the executable is on your path.

and you can change the location in the container to where makes sense, or
make a folder just for the bind, etc. The above is just for an example!
I've done similar things in the past and usually bind to some known
location, then just add it to the path in my bash profile so it's found.
