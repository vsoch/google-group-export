Hi Venessa,

I fixed the error with the Python by installing the same version of python
in the container as the host machine. I had faced the similar issue with
OpenMP a few weeks back and fixed by installing the same version on host
and container.

Yeah! the virtual environment thing won't work with singularity. But I
guess, it would be a great feature to add though I am not pretty sure about
the feasibility of the same. That is the non-sudo user gets some limited
write functionalities.

Cheers,
Jerrin
