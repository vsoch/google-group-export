Yes, that's right.

Did you by any chance install over an older version or forget to run make 
clean before compiling a new version? 

If you remove the version you have, clean, and rebuild it, do you still get 
the behavior? Like I mentioned it happened to me but at the time I was 
switching between dev and release-2.4 branches quite often so I might not 
have been diligent. 

I prefer when bugs are reproducible so I wish I knew the exact conditions 
which had caused the behavior in the first place.
