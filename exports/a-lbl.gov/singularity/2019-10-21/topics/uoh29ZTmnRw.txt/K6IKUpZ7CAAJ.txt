Greetings Singularity containerizers!

Singularity version 2.6.1 was released today and it includes a *security=20
patch for a high severity vulnerability*. =20

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3D2018-19295

The issue affects Singularity 2.4.0 through 2.6.0 on modern distributions=
=20
managed with systemd where mount points are mounted with shared mount=20
propagation by default. A malicious user with local/network access to the=
=20
host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability to mount arbitrary=
=20
directories into the host mount namespace resulting in privilege escalation=
=20
on the host.=20

Singularity 2.6.1 should be installed immediately, and all previous=20
versions of Singularity should be removed. The vulnerability addressed in=
=20
this release affects systems on which the `/` mount point or any=20
exploitable mount point (eg: `/run`, `/var` ...) are set shared. If you are=
=20
unable to upgrade immediately, you should set ` mount --make-rprivate / `=
=20
so that `/` and all mount points belonging to `/` are no longer mounted=20
shared. This change must be repeated on every reboot.  =20

Great thanks to Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE security team for=20
confidentially reporting this vulnerability to Sylabs!
