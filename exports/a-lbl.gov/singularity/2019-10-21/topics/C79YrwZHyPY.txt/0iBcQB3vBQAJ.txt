Hi Vanessa,

I've done a bit more testing today. I deleted the singularity hub 
collection, removed the webhooks and integrations from my github repository 
and started again from scratch.

When I first add the singularity collection a singularity build is 
triggered so I have a single container build. 

The issue appears to be with the Github Auto-Deployment configuration which 
throws an exception, its status icon in Integrations is a red triangle 
which when hovered over gives the message "Last delivery was not 
successful. An exception occurred", suggesting that travis is triggering 
the Auto-Deployment integration, but that is where it is failing.

The list of recent deliveries in the webhook configuration only lists ping 
and push events, so no deployment has been triggered. I assume the 
deployment even that I listed in the gist above was from using the 'Test 
Service' button on the Auto-Deployment integration.

I'm going to try varying the 'environments' field in the Auto-Deployment 
configuration and see whether that has any effect; I note that github api 
url field is also empty, but the help text suggests this is optional, so I 
assume it defaults to the main github API URL.
