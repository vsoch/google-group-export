Hi All,

I will try to consolidate replies to a few of the questions and suggestions=
=20
posted above.

To Greg's initial reply - yes, I was root at all times running Singularity.=
=20
 On the machine I use for developing this, I don't normally run Docker as=
=20
root.  But I did export the image from Docker, and try to import it into=20
Singularity, all as root.

To Chris' suggestion - I had a chance to unpack the tar file, and it=20
unpacked fine as a directory structure on my filesystem.  I have not yet=20
had the chance to try Singularity within the container and run=20
Docker2Singularity.  That will be my next task.

To R=C3=A9my - I did not have a chance to upgrade the machine I am using to=
 the=20
latest version of Docker.  I did that on another machine (where I installed=
=20
1.12), exported the container as a tar file, then tried to import it on my=
=20
original machine into Singularity - with the same results.

I will try to set up a container as Chris suggested, and will try to run=20
Docker2Singularity from within it.

Thank you all so much for your time and suggestions!

Cheers!
V.
