Unless I am misunderstanding, that would involve a recursive chown.
Something I would prefer to avoid if at all possible as it kinda abuses the
SUID privilege that Singularity has. It also would defy the principal of
least astonishment... Well at least for me it will. Or perhaps I am
confused. haha... If so, sorry, can you elaborate.

I can do a non recursive chown on just the directory `/applications` as a
compromise.

Yep. Except that they could write to the `/applications` directory, just
not any other files that are already there (unless I recursively chown).

I didn't consider the differentiation between user spaces (from the kernel
perspective, anything not kernel space is user space), but there is value
in doing that as you pointed out. So we have the "system" space which is
the non-kernel components of the operating system. Then we have a user's
environment (e.g. $HOME and scratch directories). In Singularity terms,
$HOME and scratch is shared with the host, but (again, if I am following)
you are suggesting another space that kind of sits between the two; user
controlled applications that exist within a container, maybe akin to a
software module farm?

If the application space follows the container, it doesn't violate
reproducibility of the container itself, but what about reproducibility of
creating that container (e.g. for Singularity Hub, or a build service, or
someone that wants to leverage all of your work but make some minor changes
to the recipe)? For me, the golden nugget of reproducibility is two
fold,... one is the container itself, but on the other hand, it is the
bootstrap definition file.

Yes, I agree, and apologies for my previous wording. Debugging and
development is far easier when done interactively.

<div>This would allow our users to build containers the same way they curre=
ntly do on our clusters, without them having to understand any fancy filesy=
stem mounts, overlay semantics, or external build farms.=C2=A0 Coupled with=
 Spack (an entirely user-space
 package manager) they could also easily build their dependencies in the &q=
uot;myuser&quot; directory, without worrying about portability concerns tha=
t arise from differently named home directories on different systems.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Does that make sense, and would it be an easy tweak?=C2=A0 Or am I mis=

<div>I think that is a great idea! If I am understanding correctly, could a=
n example implementation look like this:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>$ singularity shell --writable ~/container.img</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; echo $PATH</div>
<div>/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:<wbr>/usr/local/bin:/applications/b<wbr>=
in</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; cd ~/git/awesomeness</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; ./configure --prefix=3D/applications &am=
p;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If so, that would be pretty straight forward to implement.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>Yes! =C2=A0if /applications is always owned by &lt;whoever launched th=
e container&gt; then I think this is exactly my use case!</div>
