&gt; Hi Oliver,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Please see my explanation to Lars above on why these checks matter at =
build time. <br>
<br>
</span>which ones? <br>
The explanation I read only explained that you want to enforce people build=
ing singularity on older environments have to patch out the misplaced check=
s themselves. <br>
There was no explanation at all why the checks are done at build time inste=
ad of at the correct place, i.e. at post-install of the deb / rpm packages =
or at runtime. <br>
<br>
It seems there are common misconceptions about how packaging on Linux in ge=
neral works amongst the Singularity devs. <br>
I hope that&#39;s discussed at some point in Sylabs, including @gmk, who (a=
s one of the experienced persons from CentOS) should be able to point out t=
o the others why build-time checks for run-time functionality <br>
are *not* done for any Linux package, and if they are for the rare exceptio=
ns where upstream devs do not understand the implications, <br>
are generally patched out at distro level. <br>
<br>
If Singularity want&#39;s to make packaging harder by violating established=
 best practices, that&#39;s a statement on its own. Maybe the goal is not a=
nymore to see widespread adoptiona and enter Debian / RedHat main repositor=
ies,<br>
but to rather sell off Singularity Pro packages? <br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Checking for something at build time which matters =

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0For example, we build our RPMs and DEBs on the Open=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If the official statement from Sylabs is, that nobo=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0It seems there are fundamental issues with how pack=

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0That&#39;s completely unrelated to the fact that of=
