Hello,

I have found that there are some containers that I can download from both 
Docker Hub and Singularity Hub that have the binary I want to use directly 
available. For example the container for the program qiime:
https://singularity-hub.org/collections/632
Here, once the container is built, if I open it in "shell" mode, and just 
type qiime, the command runs.

However, there are other containers that when I pull, don't have the "main" 
command available in the shell (that is the program I downloaded the 
container for). I have tried to build that container in sandbox format, and 
searching for the desired binary inside reveals its location, not always in 
the same directory. For example, in the container for idba, which can be 
built with:
singularity build --sandbox idba_s/ docker://loneknightpy/idba

the desired idba binary is found in /root/idba/bin/idba. In some other 
containers, the main binary is for example in /usr/share.

But obviously, if I run in "shell" mode the container, and try to execute 
that file, Singularity is going to look for it in my host file system, and 
obviously the binary is not there, but inside the container.

So my question is, is there some way to make accessible these binaries? 
There should be, I guess, otherwise the container would be useless... I 
tried to set the PATH of the sandbox to point to where the binary is, and 
run the sandbox in shell mode, but still the binary is inaccessible. 

I tried looking for the answer for this, but I really don't even know how 
to formulate the question...

Thank you!
