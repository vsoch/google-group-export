Subject: Cgroups with singularity
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="000000000000bfe4bc057b52cc98"

I a testing out how to configure cgroups with Singularity. Cgroups are a
Good Thing (TM) and of course are intimately part of cointainers anyway.
I note in the documentation that the name of the cgroup is singularity
If you run multiple containers, surely there should eb a unique name per
container?  PErhaps the INSTANCE name.

I also see RDMA limiting is an option in the TOML file. Yaay, as that is
something I have worked on with other systems.

Lastly there is a [devices] section - so you can limit which hardware
devices a container can access. The normal use case for this is GPU cards -
so a resource manager can allocate a given GPU to a container or job. Maybe
it would be worth inserting some comments on how exactly that works in the
documentation sine I think
major = 0
minor = 0
might ot trigegr everyone to go  Aha! Those are the major and minor numbers
of a hardware device.
Also type = "a" means (I think) all types - types can be b for block or c
for character

Sorry to get a bit carried away.
