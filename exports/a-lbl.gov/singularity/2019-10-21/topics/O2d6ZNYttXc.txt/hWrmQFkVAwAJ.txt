Hi all,

We are using Singularity in a project. One of the partners is reluctant to 
install Singularity in their premises because in their opinion it has some 
security flaws. In particular, they claim that:

*It's "kind of" broken by design but only because it allows unprivileged 
users to request that the kernel interpret arbitrary data as a file system. 
The real underlying issue is that file system developers have depended for 
years on root privs being required to mount a file system. (GNOME's gVFS is 
a notable exception here.) Basically any file system issue that can result 
in a BUG or an Oops can be targeted by unprivileged users with Singularity 
(or any other system that allows unpriviledged users to mount file system 
images.) We could "check" the image before mounting but the performance 
penalty incurred would more or less negate any advantage that using this 
method brings.*


Does their concern make sense?


Thanks,
