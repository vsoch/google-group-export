Hi Ivan,

As mentioned by Vanessa you may be interested to Nextflow.

https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2016/more-fun-containers-hpc.html


In a nutshell it's a pipeline orchestration tool for scientific workflows.
It handles transparently Docker and Singularity containers and allows you
to scale your workload on different resource schedulers (SGE, SLURM, etc)
and the cloud (AWS).


Disclaimer, I'm the author.


Cheers,
Paolo
