Subject: Re: [Singularity] Instances: runscript vs startscript in bootstraped containers
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="000000000000c03d49056d863a5e"

So this is an interesting idea.  Instances are fairly new to Singularity.
Before they existed, both CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker speak just
corresponded to a runscript in Singularity speak.  See here for the details.

http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-docker

But now that we also have a startscript (because we have instances), it may
be useful to revisit this topic and think about how that relates to
Docker.  Does CMD == startscript and ENTRYPOINT == runscript?  Or should
Singularity just give the user the option at buildtime to move a runscript
to a startscript or vice versa?  What do others think?
