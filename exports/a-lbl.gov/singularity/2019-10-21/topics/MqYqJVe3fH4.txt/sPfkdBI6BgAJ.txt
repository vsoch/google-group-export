I keep getting questions that ask if when I do an mpirun -n 4 singularity=
=20
exec image (or similar srun -n4) am I running in 4 different container=20
instances of the same image or just 1.
How do I answer this question?  I found this:

"I think you are misunderstanding the basic nature of the Singularity=20
=E2=80=9Ccontainer=E2=80=9D. It=E2=80=99s just a file system overlay. So =
=E2=80=9Csharing=E2=80=9D a container is=20
no different than running on a node where the procs all see the same file=
=20
system. Thus, having multiple containers that are identical makes no sense=
=20
- it=E2=80=99s all the same file system."

Still not sure how to answer the question.  When I use instance.start and=
=20
then mpirun -n 4 singularity exec instance://image, how is that different=
=20
from the previous run (exec image)?  I can see that there is a PID linked=
=20
to the container when I do a singularity instance.list.

Can someone explain to me how it works so I can answer these questions?

Thanks,
-Steve
