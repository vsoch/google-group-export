Hi All,
Must MPI inside and outside of the container be compiled with exactly the 
same options (assuming it is the same version of MPI)?
In particular, if MPI on the host links to Mellanox libraries, does it mean 
that exactly the same libraries must be installed inside the container? 
Considering the difference in OS versions, that might be problematic. Is it 
better to build MPI inside and outside without such optimizations?
Thank you,
Igor
