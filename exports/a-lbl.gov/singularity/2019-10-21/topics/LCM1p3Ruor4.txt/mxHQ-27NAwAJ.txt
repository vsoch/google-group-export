The sysadmin could tell you for sure if root squash is enabled or you could 
create a directory with permissions 777 and "sudo touch somefile". if the 
owner and group are nfsnobody or something to that effect then you have 
root squash. In many places it's on by default. 

If you compile in a local directory then you'll be fine, try /tmp
