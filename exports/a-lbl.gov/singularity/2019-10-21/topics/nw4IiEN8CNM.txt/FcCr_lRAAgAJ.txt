Dear all,

I am interested in deploying Singularity instances in different network 
namespaces. 
A usecase example is : 
  - 2 hosts
  - each hosts containing 4 namespaces
  - each namespace running 1 singularity instance
  - all singularity instances being able to communicate with each other 
across the hosts, 
I would be interested in being able to start an instance and see this 
instance being automatically affected to a newly created namespace and 
automatically attributed an IP address. 
The IP address would not necessarily be local to the host and for instance, 
it would be interesting to make use of an etcd cluster (as an example of a 
lightweight solution) so that instances on different hosts can easily 
communicate.

I read that Michael Bauer last work on that issue in a particular branch of 
his repo in August 2017, 
see https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!topic/singularity/uqN6GIl77vs
However, the feature was not totally implemented.

Are there any news about the support of network namespaces by Singularity 
in the near future? (the documentation currently states that "As of 2.4, 
Singularity can support the network namespace to a limited degree. At 
present, we just use it for isolation, but it will soon be more 
featurefull.") 

Best regards,
Carla
