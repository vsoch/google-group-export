Hi Michael
Thank you for your answers. They are very informative. I have only one 
clarification regarding my question 1 and the corresponding answer: I mean 
that users of singbuild group can only run sudo if they run `sudo 
singularity build <imagename>.sif Singularity.def`. All other commands are 
not runnable, for example if users run `sudo singularity shell myimage.sif 
`, they system will require password.  And if even password is provided 
correctly, users will actually get a message saying something like "users 
is not allowed to run sudo with command /usr/local/bin/singularity". With 
that said, is it still a security problem? 

Apart from that, a remote build can be an option in many cases. 

Cheers,
Vang
