oh that is super cool! If the celery workers are part of the web service,
this is a reasonable approach I think. I would use a standard (front
server) set up with some application (e.g., django or flask driven if you
are using Python) controlling / set up with a queue, and instead of having
the job queue living with the frontend server part, I would have one async
task that has the job to assess metadata (eg, is this a user of cluster X?
how much memory and time does it need?) to send it to your infrastructure
queue (a different queue!) to first pass through authentication,
authorization, etc. Actually, you could probably also do this with an
internal API. I've never tried, but it seems like it would be challenging
to require the celery connected to the web application to actually control
the nodes. If you get in some situation of wanting to add another set of
(kind of different or external nodes) it would be hard to do. If each is
sort of modular (meaning the celery workers have an authenticated general
message they can send anywhere, to multiple kinds of nodes) that seems like
a good approach.
