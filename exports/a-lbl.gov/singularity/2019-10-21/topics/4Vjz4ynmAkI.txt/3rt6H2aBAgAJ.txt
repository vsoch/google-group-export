Hi all,

singularity -B is used to mount some directories so that those directories 
can be used inside the singularity container. However, there are some 
directories that I would like to exclude. For example, I would like to use
singularity shell -B /foo/ bar.simg to have access to /foo

But I would like to exclude /foo/foo1/ in the container. Is there any way 
to work around this?


Best,
Tong
