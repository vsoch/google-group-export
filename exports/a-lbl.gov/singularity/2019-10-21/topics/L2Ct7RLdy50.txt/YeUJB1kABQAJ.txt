Hey there containerizers!

I have some good news for you to kick the weekend off right! 

The punchline is that Singularity can still securely support SLES11.  This 
includes many Cray systems!

Turns out that the kernel DOES support PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS but it is not 
implemented in user space.  That's good because we can just do it 
ourselves.  

Check it out!
