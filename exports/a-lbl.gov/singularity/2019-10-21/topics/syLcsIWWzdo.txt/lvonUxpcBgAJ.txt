Basically, I wasn't able to figure out how to do that (sounds like neither 
did Brian) -- how do I call an "external" sbatch with all the needed 
environment variables?  

A straightforward example would be perfect, if someone has solved this!

<br>&gt; =C2=A0-- a job running within a singularity container that passes =
an sbatch
<br>&gt; command (similar to qsub) to the &quot;global&quot; scheduler. =C2=
=A0It has to do with the
<br>&gt; container interacting with its &quot;global&quot; environment -- w=

<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; I think one of the issues that came up is how it might be bad prac=

<br>&gt; my case, what I end up doing is having the container build the job=
s, but
<br>&gt; then I have to manually (in the &quot;outside&quot; environment) s=

<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; I think the basic request is allowing a container to execute somet=
