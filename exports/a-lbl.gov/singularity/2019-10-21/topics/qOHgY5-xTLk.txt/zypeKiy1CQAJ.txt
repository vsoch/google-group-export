Hi Oliver,

Sandbox support will remain. I'll let someone else address the SIF=20
structural / sync concerns.

<br>&gt; In a nutshell, Singularity is the only container system that uses =
a single file runtime image. This single file format was one of the primary=
 design considerations for Singularity as it facilitates user freedom, mobi=

rd we are devoting quite a bit of engineering resources to further enhancin=
g the SIF format to include features like guaranteed reproducibility and tr=
usted environments via cryptographically signed and validated runtime image=
s (which no other container runtime can do).
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; The v3 release of Singularity that will include these features is =
targeted for this summer, so stay tuned! Also, we are planning on making a =
