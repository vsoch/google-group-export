Well, in my opinion GitHub would have been fantastic in my mind. On the
simple side, I was planning to obtain several base containers from some
contributors and make them available for download, but there is no reason
not to expand that and allow others to also post their work to be shared to
their collegues, or even reference in scientific articles as reproducible
workflows. It very quickly falls victim to feature creep! haha

It isn't difficult to build a base distribution and the use case you
describe for simply getting a shell in a container, but some application
stacks and workflows are quite difficult to integrate and replicate. That
is where I think Singularity really shines.
