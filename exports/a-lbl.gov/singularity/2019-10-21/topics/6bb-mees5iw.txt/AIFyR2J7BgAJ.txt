Hi Thomas,

The solution you propose is interesting and I believe i can make use of it
in other situations, thank you. In the case I had in mind I am not sure it
can be used: ideally I would have only one tool per "guest" container, and
then connect them (and run them) with a worflow engine living in the "host"
container. Therefore i would only run the container once (single command to
run the workflow engine) so i assume i would not be able to play with the
environment variables as you suggested (which would have been mostly
changing the PATH variable to isolate the libraries of each tool i guess).

Michael

<br>
if the need for isolation is not too large, one way might be to just use<br=

(old fashioned) different environment setups in the container (if you<br>
really need to have more than one workflow per container)<br>
<br>
I.e.,<br>
if all the use cases share somewhat the same libs/bins, you could add<br>
env setup functions to the environment section [1] to get the paths in<br>
the container right for each use case.<br>
<br>
Then -for &#39;automatic&#39; execution or so- one could update the action<=
br>
scripts at the end of the %post section [2].<br>
So, that one or the other setup-function is executed for singularity<br>
shell/execute/run/..., e.g., by adding on SINGULARITYENV_ envvars, so<br>
that auser can choose his/her desired environment in the container by<br>
exporting the corresponding envvar before starting the container.<br>
<br>
Vanessa has a very good guide on how to tweak the action scripts<br>
