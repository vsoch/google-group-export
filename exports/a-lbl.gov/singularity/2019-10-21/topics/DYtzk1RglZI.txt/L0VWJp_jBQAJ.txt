you can cp files to your container before updating with the %Setup Option 
like this:

# BeeGFS managment server
BootStrap: library
From: centos:7
Include: yum

%post
 yum -y update -x setup
 yum install -y wget net-tools
 wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/beegfs_rhel7.repo 
https://www.beegfs.io/release/latest-stable/dists/beegfs-rhel7.repo
 yum install -y beegfs-mgmtd beegfs-utils
 /opt/beegfs/sbin/beegfs-setup-mgmtd -p /data/mgmtd1/
 chmod +x /etc/init.d/runmgm.sh

%setup
        mkdir -p ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/etc/beegfs/
        cp /home/admin/def/confs/beegfs-mgmtd.conf 
${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/etc/beeg$
        cp /home/admin/def/runmgm.sh ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/etc/init.d/
 
%startscript
 /home/admin/def/runmgm.sh
