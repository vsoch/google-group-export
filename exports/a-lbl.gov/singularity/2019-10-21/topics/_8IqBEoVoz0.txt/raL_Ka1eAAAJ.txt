oh that's a very cool idea! I agree that it's most common to see one
version per container, but perhaps there is a reasonable way to support
some kind of tag or version for the same software? It's not unheard of that
someone might want more than one. The first way is rather simple and dumb,
just name different folders:

/apps/fancyname-1.0
/apps/fancyname-2.0

in the same way a tag for ubuntu:14.04 generates a singularity image named
ubuntu-14.04 we squash the version into one string. The next option would
be to have something similar to modules, but then the apps runscript
(still) loads some user preference:

/apps/fancyname/1.0
/apps/fancyname/2.0

and then like you said, link the runscript in the base folder of
apps/fancyname to one of those versions. The question I want to know then,
is how to install software without telling singularity some version? We
could either make the version required and enforce the second of the above
two, or we could do what is done with unspecified tags, and call it latest.

/apps/fancyname/latest

But that is probably misleading, because who knows if it's latest?

I think what we could do is encourage some standard way of specifying
version in the folder organization as a best practice (but not required or
essential) and then leave it up to the user to determine logic. Arguably,
we don't really care about what kind of structure the user provides in the
apps folder (it's determined by the %appinstall foo section) as long as the
%apprun section executes something relative to the top folder. That
execution thing could either be calling one directly, or some other logic
to determine which one is called. What do others thing? Should we write
some kind of suggested best practice into SCI-F, or change the structure /
naming schema in some way to embed labels?

* +1 fancyname! But what will it do ?
