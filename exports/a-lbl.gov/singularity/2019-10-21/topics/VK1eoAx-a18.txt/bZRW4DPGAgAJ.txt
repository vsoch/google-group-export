Hi Greg,

Nope you were reading what I said right.

The things is, I am trying to build an image that would be compatible with
the GPUs on our cluster. From personal experience, it seems that the image
needs to be able to access a set of NVIDIA driver libraries. These NVIDIA
drivers are located on the host machine, but I currently have the driver
libraries installed on the image itself as well. This works fine, but I'm
worried that I'll run into issues if I try to run the image on a host
machine that has a different version of the driver installed. In fact, from
my brief testing, using a different version of the NVIDIA driver libraries
on the image and on the host machine seemed to cause my program to fail.

So I was talking to some other people at the office, and I came up with a
few ideas. The most straightforward, but possibly laborious, solution is to
prepare one image for each type of driver. This would allow us to install a
compatible image on any of the compute nodes. A different solution would be
to prepare one image with the libraries of all of the different types of
driver installed. For each driver version, I could perhaps have a different
directory in /usr/local. Then, when we added the image to a node, we could
perhaps point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the appropriate directory.

Anyways, that was a bit of a digression. So there is no seeming way that we
would be able to take advantage of the drivers installed on the host
machine? Of course anything like this would lower container portability,
but that would seemingly be ok, because these images are already highly
specialized anyways.

Thanks!
Nathan
