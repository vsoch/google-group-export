:( 
Are you using cgroup and NFS (v3/v4?)

You can raise a ticket to Red Hat support and add your findings/details to
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/452

OTOH, they might ask you to upgrade to 6.8 and apply all the updates...
Current kernel version is kernel-2.6.32-642.13.1.el6.x86_64.
if you can reproduce the crash, if it does crash/panic, you can raise
add your findings/details to the github issue.

Cheers
