This was primarily the output of "singularity help import".  I thought
there was a web page documenting this.  But going back all the things
I could back track to, they were all either rehashing the output of
that command.

I am certainly no expert at any of these.  I've started trying
containers to leverage their benefits, and I started with Docker as
one of the applications I support needs system level access and
modification capability.  I started looking at Singularity as it
seemed more appropriate for another container I created that did not
need system level access.  I should probably have started creating the
Singularity version of that container from scratch, as suggested
earlier.  But the import functionality was too tempting to pass up ...

I've not yet built and installed Docker myself on any of the systems I
support and use, but if needed, going forward, I can try to get that
set up, if there are any test cases you might want me to try out.
