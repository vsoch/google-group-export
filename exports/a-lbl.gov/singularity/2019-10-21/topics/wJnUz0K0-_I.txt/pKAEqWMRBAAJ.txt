Hi,

I hav a requirement to install a local singularity hub portal for local office internal use only.  I have installed one to a host on the local lan, eg:http://shub.local.net  I can login into it via twitter auth, create users and the rest of the web ui works ok.  I just cannot get a client to push an image up to a collection.. I have gone through the documentation online and i must have missed something or not understood something, but when i run sregistry from the singularity-pyhon option, I get a KeyError:'username' 

any ideas anyone? or recommended simplest method to allow for users to push singularity images into the internal singularity hub?  

Or maybe i am reading the wrong client info? 

any advice on getting an internal hub configured would be much appreciated

cheer,
Marcelo
