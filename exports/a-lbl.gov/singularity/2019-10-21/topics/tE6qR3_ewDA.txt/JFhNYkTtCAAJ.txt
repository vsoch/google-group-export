I wonder why it is using the full path to the test.mop file... There a few
things you can do to debug/test (just make sure you are using a fairly
recent version of the git repo):

At the top of the sspec, add "DebugOS: yes", and then rebuild. It will
include lots of debugging tools. Then when you build the spec run it like
this:

$ singularity install mopac.sapp
$ singularity shell mopac

That will launch an interactive shell within the mopac container. I would
recommend running mopac through strace (a feature to automatically do this
is coming later today) and see if you can identify any new information. It
is quite possible that the code is doing something "smart" to try and
figure out the pwd/cwd which is what is causing this error.

Also, please note that the license path you specified in the runscript I
don't think will resolve. I would also recommend changing your call to
mopac to be this:

exec mopac "$@"

Let me know how it works out!
