Heya Taras,

Sorry for the late response. I somehow missed your email...

I am strongly considering bringing some of the building features back from
1.x into 2.2, but not sure exactly how much or what it will look like. I
was just about to work on this being that the most of the backend
architecture work I've been working on is just about done now.

Do you have any particular requests aside from application bundles (SAPPs)?

This is exactly correct for 2.1. 2.2 has some additional potential. For
example the backend now supports operating on an image directory and if you
are running a new enough kernel, it can do this without any privilege
escalation (using user namespaces). So in theory it is possible...

But, on the other hand, it is very difficult to bootstrap a new image as a
user because YUM/APT/DNF I don't believe will run as a regular user (this
however deserves additional tests). But, if we can simply pull
files/packages from the host operating system and build a container based
on that, then technically we should not need root. So as I mentioned, 2.2
has some potential. :)

If you or anybody else has any feature requests they would like to see in
2.2, how is a good time to make them! I won't guarantee to incorporate them
into 2.2 (or ever), but now is a good time to make the cases for inclusion
into 2.2.
