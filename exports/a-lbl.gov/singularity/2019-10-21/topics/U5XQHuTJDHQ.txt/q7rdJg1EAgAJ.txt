To have sudo inside the container, the user needs to be sudo outside the
container, and yes to run with sudo privileges

So this is sort of a contradiction - something along the lines of having
cake and eating it too :_) Do you trust your users to do this? And what is
your setup? If you want them to easily develop containers with write, you
might consider having them build/develop with Docker locally, and then pull
the read only versions onto the cluster.
