Dear All,

I am building Singularity from source into versioned folders, e.g. 
/opt/singularity/2.4.2, and based on the outcome I am creating RPM packages 
from it to be deployed by our users on some Linux workstations. Reason that 
I am building my own packages from source (using make clean; make; sudo 
make install)  is that I want the users to be able to switch between 
Singularity versions in the future (using module files) - so we need the 
capability to install multiple versions in parallel. 

I am building Singularity currently for RedHat 6, and I guess I have to do 
this also for RedHat 7 and CentOs 7, which will result at the end in three 
different packages. Very soon I need to run Singularity also on RedHat 6 
servers, and I was told by out infrastructure group that RedHat 6 
workstations and servers are looking quite different. I am wondering, if it 
is necessary to build my RPM packages specifically for workstation or 
server usage for a certain OS, which would double the number of packages. 
Or if it is enough to just build it for an OS as I am doing it in the 
moment. 

Would be great, if somebody could answer this question. Thanks!

Kind regards,
Manuel Schwarze
