Hi Jason,

I've been thinking about this... Maybe it makes sense to make this
conditional? If /etc/yum.conf exists, maybe include that too somehow? What
I can see is someone doing a "InstallPkg yum epel-release" and expecting
the next command to include the EPEL repo. If we hard code the --config
option to YUM, I think we will break that expected behavior.

Thoughts?
