Well, that's not the land it comes from and some of us work in, and I
hope it's not going to emigrate more than necessary for educational
purposes.

I don't see how easily Unix-scriptable components are at odds with "web"
and specifically "desktop" usage.  We had a principle that anything in
our original graphical "workflow" (if you like) system could be done
equivalently by typing at the command line, later extended to the
RESTful (if you like) interface to the server components.  That system
was an important factor in successful competition with LBL, as it
happens.

A good reason for not having information duplicated is maintaining
consistency.  The header is doubtless the best sole place for anything
that's not specifically relevant inside the container and I'm not sure
off-hand what might be necessary inside.

However, /runscript at least needs to be allowed to provide help, as in
my example (which just has /usr/bin/scilab linked to /singularity).  It
takes 0.2-0.3s on my system, and is clearly simpler than invoking
singularity <something> directly, which would be perfectly fine for a
container that replied "unrecognized option".
