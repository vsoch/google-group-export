Subject: Re: [Singularity] Re: Creating a container from a vnfs?

Hi Jai,

  Well ... in this case singularity is beating out wwmkchroot it some
ways. ;)  For example you can do something like:

    # cd /var/chroots
    # singularity build --sandbox centos7-base docker://centos:latest
      [ ... ]
    # singularity shell -w --sandbox centos7-base/
      [ ... add packages, etc... ]

  And have a functional root. Or you can setup a Singularity DEF file
to build out a root. You can then do:  wwvnfs
--chroot=3D/var/chroots/centos7-base --name=3Dcentos7-base  ... and have a
"functional" VNFS built for warewulf. And since it was built initially
with singularity, it would have the /.singularity.d directory
included. Singularity is giving more functionality in a lot of cases
that wwmkchroot currently has.

  That's the biggest issue that I see.... Singularity takes a
directory, or tarball, _as is_ and just adds it into a squashfs image.
It doesn't add the metadata directory in with these. From what I can
tell, the reason came down to a workflow like:

    # singularity build --sandbox centos docker://centos:6
    # singularity build centos6.img centos/

  So, you _start_ with a sandbox directory, which has the
/.singularity.d ... and you make an image from that. From what I see
that was the expected work flow, and why it doesn't try adding the
environment in when creating from a directory.
