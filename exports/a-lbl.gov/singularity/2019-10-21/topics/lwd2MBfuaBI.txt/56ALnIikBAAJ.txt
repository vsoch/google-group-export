This is not an answer to your direct question, but may help some.

I assume you have a Windows PC where you have admin privileges and a linux 
machine(s) where you do not.  You want to run the container on the linux 
box.

If so, I would suggest:
Install and use VirtualBox on your PC.  Install a linux distribution.
Within the container install singularity
run singularity build to generate an image
Copy that image to the linux system

I don't understand it completely, but basically to build containers you 
have to be root.  There are lots of references to "reduced functionality" 
when building as non-root, but I don't understand those comments (ie what 
is 'reduced').

I would also suggest moving to the 3.x series if at all possible.

Regards.
