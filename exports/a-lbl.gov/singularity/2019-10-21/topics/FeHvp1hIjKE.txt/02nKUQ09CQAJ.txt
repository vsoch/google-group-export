The root permission is not available in HPC environment. So I need create the Singularity image in my laptop environment.  My question is that should I install all the dependent libraries (such as MPI, Intel MKL  etc) with the same version and the same path location before compiling the applications?    
What's the best practice for packaging the application into Singularity which have some dependences on the libraries in HPC environment?
