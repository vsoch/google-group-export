Subject: Re: [Singularity] Celery RabbitMQ worker packaged in a Singularity container

If management of resources (nodes) is in order, I think a proper job
manager might be better fit for this job. Celery (from how I've used it) is
more appropriate for a situation like a web application where you want the
server to have a job queue, and put tasks in it to run when there is free
compute time (and to run async). They are similar because a "master" node
maps to the broker, and the "slaves" map to the workers. Also in my
experience the workers are on and ready, which would translate to having
multiple container instances running and listening for tasks. Is there a
reason you have preference for celery instead of traditional SLURM / SGE /
other? I think if you really wanted to do this fully it would be most
logical to add an actual supporting plugin for singularity workers to
rabbitmq:

https://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/index.jsp#com.vmware.vfabric.rabbitmq.2.4/=
plugin-development.html

Or something similar with celery. Keep us in the loop!
