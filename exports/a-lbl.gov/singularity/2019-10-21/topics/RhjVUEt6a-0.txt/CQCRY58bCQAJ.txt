Thanks Greg 
Vanessa , I had seen the link you put up but by then I had already created 
a Singularity image container from the docker image using the docker export 
command.
I cannot provide the docker image that I built it has some stuff that is 
not public domain.

The failure took place when I was doing this...

First create a tar file.

"docker save -o <tarfilename> <docker image file>  


 and then  try to convert it by using

sudo singularity import <singualrityshell.img> <tarfilename>.

It failed saying there was no /bin/sh , which wasn't true but I guess that 
is just a stock error.

I will run this with the debug commands that Greg suggested and will get 
back.

S
