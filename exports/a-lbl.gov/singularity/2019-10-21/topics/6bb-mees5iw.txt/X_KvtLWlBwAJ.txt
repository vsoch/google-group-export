Hi All,

I am faced with the exact same problem as Ivan originally posted: I have 
one host singularity container (because HPC) and within this container I 
would like to run various "guest" isolated containers (Docker or 
Singularity).

As far as I know Next Flow doesn't solve the original problem as it is 
still based on a single-layer of containers (what if two containers need 
different versions of common libraries?). Would anyone know a solution to 
this problem? It seems running singularity within singularity is not 
possible (would be glad to be told the opposite) and i saw no information 
on running docker containers within a singularity container.

Michael
