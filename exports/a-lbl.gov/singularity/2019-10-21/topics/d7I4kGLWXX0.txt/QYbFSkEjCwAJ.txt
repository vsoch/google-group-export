Hi,

I would like to import a library (OpenFOAM-1.6-ext) installed on my Ubuntu 
18.04 into a container so I can use it on a HPC system. I'm new to the 
container technology. I tried to tarball the OpenFOAM-1.6-ext directory and 
image.import it to a singularity container. However, I was having issue 
exporting it on a HPC system, which made me think that was not the right 
way. I've been reading the user guide and I couldn't figure out what to do.

Thanks,
Wensi
