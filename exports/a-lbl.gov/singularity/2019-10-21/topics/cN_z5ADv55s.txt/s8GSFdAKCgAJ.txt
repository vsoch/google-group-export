Warewulf doesn't have any bash scripts, but I am using the -T option
throughout the code which identifies any "tainted" variables and disables
them from being used until they have been checked. That particular feature
causes more bugs and errors then anything else in the code, but it also
ensures that nothing ever gets missed and used in a non-anticipated way.
