Hi Chris,

In a matter of speaking, it really depends on the MPI. For example (as I
understand) Intel MPI includes the IB/OmniPath support within the MPI
implementation itself and doesn't require the OFED user space libraries.
Where something like OMPI would. Now if you compiled your OFED libraries in
the same place you were bind mounting the OpenMPI from on your host, *and*
if those libraries were glibc compatible with your container (which I am
assuming they were, because you didn't mention any problems), then all
would indeed work as expected!

Hope that helps, and yes on the PR to the docs! PLEASE!

Thanks!

Greg
