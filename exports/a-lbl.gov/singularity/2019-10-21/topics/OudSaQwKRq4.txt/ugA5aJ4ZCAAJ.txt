Hello.

I created a custom singularity image using sudo singularity build -2 
someName.img someFile
Then I tried logging into the image as root and installing further software 
for testing, but I received this error:

You don't have enough free space in /var/cache/apt/archives/

In the docs for version 2.4 
(http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-build-container) there is no information 
on how to define the size of an image on build. How do I create an image 
which is large enough (e.g. 4 GB) so that I can install plenty of 
additional software for development?

Thank you.
