I am probably making a fool of myself here (what's new then....). would
user namespaces help http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html

I am currently working with sssd and there is a handy utility called
sss_override which allows uid mapping. But that wont work unless sssd is
running
