since singularity uses the current user when a container is run, shouldnt 
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR be mapped or created by default (much like HOME and /tmp)?

e.g. jupyter uses XDG_RUNTIME_DIR when starting up notebook; to get this to 
work in singularity you need to use --bind /run so my user /run/user/1005 
is picked up when jupyter notebook boots

i would think the best way would to by default map it from the host unless 
overridden within the def file

note: the workaround for me is simply adding /run to SINGULARITY_BIND or 
using --bind from shell when starting the an instance
