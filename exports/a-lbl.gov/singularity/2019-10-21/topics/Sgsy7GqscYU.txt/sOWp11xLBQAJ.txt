Hi David,

I can touch on this since I was lobbying hard for Go. As far as our decisio=
n to move away from Python/Shell in the CLI:

1. The code base was becoming difficult to manage and debug, etc=E2=80=A6
2. We wanted to switch to a compiled language to avoid runtime dependencies=
 as much as possible.

On reasonings for choosing Golang over other languages that might have been=
 selected:

1. Go has a lot of industry weight behind it. Many of the other major proje=
cts in the container ecosystem are using Go to develop their software. By c=
hoosing Go, we=E2=80=99ll be able to better leverage said rich ecosystem be=
st.
2. Rust, specifically, isn=E2=80=99t the right tool for the job that we=E2=
=80=99re working on at the moment. We=E2=80=99re really only completely mov=
ing the front-end to Go, while the backend will remain largely in C (with a=
 small Go wrapper to better facilitate interaction). If we were looking to =
completely re-implement the runtime in a new language, then Rust would prob=
ably be one of the languages we consider (this isn=E2=80=99t something we=
=E2=80=99re considering right now).
3. It=E2=80=99s easier to quickly become productive in Go when using it for=
 the first time. Most of the members of the developer team had minimal or n=
o experience in Go or Rust before starting this project, and with Go we=E2=
=80=99ve been able to become productive very quickly while learning the lan=
guage at the same time. I think this blog post provides a bit of insight in=
to this: https://matthias-endler.de/2017/go-vs-rust/ <https://matthias-endl=
er.de/2017/go-vs-rust/>

When you ask how long the python version will be supported, what kind of su=
pport do you mean?
