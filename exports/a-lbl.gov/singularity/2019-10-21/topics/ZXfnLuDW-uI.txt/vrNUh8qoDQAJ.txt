Subject: Bootstrap method for cross building redhat/debian
To: singularity@lbl.gov

Hi,


It is been a while I did not test singularity. It seems that it moves
pretty fast. It is quite a good indicator of the dynamism of a project -
however, commands from version 1 are not working anymore.

I have a question regarding the bootstrap method which seems to be the only
way to build a container now. If I want to build a redhat-base container
from a debian-like distro (or the opposite), what would be the prefered way
to bootstrap it ?
I take a look at the documentation (
http://singularity.lbl.gov/bootstrap-image ), and it seems to be "docker" -
and only docker (except if you install some cross packaging tools before
like, for instance, alien ??) ??

Thanks,

Best regards,
Remy
