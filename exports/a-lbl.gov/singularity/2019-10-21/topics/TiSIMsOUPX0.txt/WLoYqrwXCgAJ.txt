I am running Singularity through TravisCI already, but I am surely not
using it to it's fullest potential. If anyone wants to help out with my
travis.yml I would be just as appreciative!

Compatibility should be just fine between versions BTW. There are some new
bootstrap'ing features and helper wrappers that exist in the 2.1 generated
containers, but it will maintain backwards compatibility.
