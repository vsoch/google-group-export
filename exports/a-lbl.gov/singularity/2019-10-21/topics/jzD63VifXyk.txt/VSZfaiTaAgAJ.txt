Hi,

The UT Southwestern BioHPC group (https://portal.biohpc.swmed.edu) is using 
Singularity to ease installation of applications on our HPC cluster. We are 
currently running RHEL 6.x (upgrading to 7.x later this year), and continue 
to have issues with various applications that expect newer distros / libs. 
Our user base of biomedical researchers are often not familiar with 
software installation, so we need to maintain a very large collection of 
software modules relative to our size and number of team members.

Singularity offers huge promise as a way to allow us to quickly deploy 
software that e.g. expects recent Ubuntu, without days of effort rebuilding 
from source, tracking down deps etc. Deep learning and visuzalization 
packages are particularly problematic for us. The effort required to 
install frequent updates, building from source on an older OS, is extremely 
high relative to the usage of the packages. However, the packages are vital 
to some researchers so we must make them available.

Example - we had a request from 3 users for the latest version of Blender 
(www.blender.org). Binaries require GLIBC 2.19 which is newer than our 
cluster has. We use a Windows VM approach to support some other software, 
with 3D rendering on the host GPU using the NICE DCV product. This didn't 
work for blender. A singularity image of the latest blender on Ubuntu took 
approx. 1 hr to produce. GPU support worked, as did using VirtualGL inside 
the container to render on the GPU, forwarding graphics into a TurboVNC 
server on the host for display on the user desktop. In this case 
Singularity saved multiple days of effort and frustration building the deep 
dependency tree of blender.

We also plan to leverage https://biocontainers.pro and singularity to 
provide trivial access for user to a very large range of versioned 
bioinformatics software, automatically making new packages/versions 
available. We have an in-house web-based workflow platform using Nextflow, 
and wish to encourage use of containerized apps here as a way of improving 
long-term reproducibility and insulating bioinformaticians from the impacts 
of cluster updates etc, which can impact a traditional module stack of 
software.

Finally, it's possible that Singularity will give users enough freedom that 
we can avoid having to implement complex multi-image cluster or openstack 
VM environment which has been looking increasingly likely.

Many thanks for all your work!
