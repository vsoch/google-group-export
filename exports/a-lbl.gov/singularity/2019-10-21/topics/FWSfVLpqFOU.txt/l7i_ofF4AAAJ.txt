Dear all,

For testing purpose I need to run a Singularity container with only a 
subset of cores from my machine. 
For this purpose I chose to use the "taskset" command and to use is as 
follows:
  taskset --cpu-list 0-6 singularity instance.start /image.img myinstance

In this case I restricted my container instance to use 7 cores (child 
processes included) and the command "taskset -c -p PID" confirms this well.
However, once I am inside my container instance, I get to run heavy jobs 
such as "stress-ng --cpu 22 -t 1m" (running a CPU load on 22 cores for 1 
minute) and the jobs are actually using more cores than the 7 I allowed. 

Are there any reason why I might not be able to restrict the number of 
cores of a container instance?

Best,
Carla
