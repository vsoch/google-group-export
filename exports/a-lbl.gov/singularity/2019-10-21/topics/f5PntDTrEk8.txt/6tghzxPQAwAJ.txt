Notice to all Singularity users, contributors, and collaborators:

Singularity continues to gain popularity and traction very quickly. This
growth has been extremely demanding on my time and is outpacing my ability
to sustain the broad amount of use cases for the rapidly expanding
community with me working on it only part time. In order to meet this
rapidly expanding growth, I have created a new organization,
SingularityWare, LLC, which is dedicated to further developing Singularity,
supporting the associated open source community and growing the project. To
facilitate this, I have partnered with a company, RStor, Inc.

RStor is not only interested in the success of Singularity, as an open
source, scientific enabling platform, but they are bringing their own very
compelling and much needed cloud based storage/RDM platform to market. A
partnership like this (containerized computing coupled with a cloud based
storage platform) offers a very exciting and synergistic value to research
computing.

In addition to continuing my leadership of Singularity (and the new LLC), I
will be maintaining my association with Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, as a scientific advisor as well as continuing other efforts I
am associated with (e.g. Warewulf and OpenHPC).

This means that I now have the resources and ability to both offer support
for Singularity and hire key developers, and I would like to invite
interested people to send me your resume! I am looking to hire both part
time and full time staff engineers as well as University collaborations to
fund interns, graduates and postdocs for Singularity development and
relevant involvement.

Aside from additional resources, dedication, attention, and growth, the
overall direction of the project will remain the same.

If you have any questions, comments or want to be part of this exciting new
endeavor, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you!
