Hi Gregory,

Thanks for your answer.

Initially, we also thought that the process was swapping or that there was 
a misconfiguration with our swapping settings. However, it seems that it is 
all fine (i.e., the process is not swapping and our configuration is fine). 
In fact, I guess that if the process was able to swap, it would also happen 
when we run it without the Singularity.

I was wondering if the Singularity implements its own "out-of-memory 
killer" or something similar. I imagined that maybe the Singularity 
receives the signal but it handles it in a specific way which doesn't kill 
the process directly. Does it make any sense?

Thanks once again and have a nice week.

Augusto.
