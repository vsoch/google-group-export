Heya Stack!

Yes, we really need to do something at SC but we didn't get too many hands
of who is going. Probably because I asked for a volunteer... and nobody
wants to volunteer for anything unless it involves free food! So let's try
this again without asking for a volunteer (unless a company wants to
volunteer and sponsor a dinner?? LOL)...

<yells louder>... HEY EVERYONE! Who's going to be at SC16?! Show of hands
with a response of availability times for doing something awesome.

Thanks!
