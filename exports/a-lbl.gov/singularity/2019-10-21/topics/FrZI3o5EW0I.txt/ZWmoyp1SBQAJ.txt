Hello.

I am trying to build a c++ file in my singularity container. How can I 
install the required libraries? They exist on my computer:

ls /usr/lib | wc -l
468

But as soon as I shell into the singularity image:

ls /usr/lib/ | wc -l
16

I tried to include the installation of the library in the %setup section of 
the Singularity file, but:

apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove

So the singularity image cannot access local c++ libraries and it cannot 
install any because they already exist locally? Why does this make sense 
and how do I solve the problem?

The image should be ubuntu based:

Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu

And inside the shell I cannot run apt-get install because it keeps telling 
me the packages have not been found.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
