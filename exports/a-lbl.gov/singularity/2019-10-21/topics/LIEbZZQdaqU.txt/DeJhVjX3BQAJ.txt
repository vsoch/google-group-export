Hello,

we are having singularity 2.2.1 on our clusters, and I am building most 
containers there.

On my laptop I am running an Ubuntu VM with singularity 2.2.99.

I have noticed two things where the 2.2.99 is different than 2.2.1 and 
would appreciate comments on that. The particular container definition is 
at 
https://github.com/mcuma/chpc_singularity/blob/master/ubuntu_python/ubuntu_python.def

1. On 2.2.99, right after the docker image is pulled, I get an error:
ERROR  : Overly-long string encountered.
ABORT  : Retval = 255

I have traced this to the long commented section in the %post section, 
lines 86-99. If I remove it, or put it e.g. to the start of the definition 
file, the container builds.

2. I have a mistake in this definition file, ln. 73:
 python3-pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
should be 
 pip3 install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip

On 2.2.1, the container build crashes when hitting this error, complaining 
command not found.
On 2.2.99, there is still complaint command not found but the container 
build continues.

Was there a change in how errors get handled in the development version?

Thanks,
MC
