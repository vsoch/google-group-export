Hi!

There=E2=80=99s an informal and impromptu JoF (Just-in-Time BoF) to discuss
Singularity, a new tool for containers in HPC Wednesday at 5:15 p.m. in the
Trade Room behind Starbucks.

We=E2=80=99ve deployed Singularity at SDSC and think it=E2=80=99s going to =
have a big
impact by providing =E2=80=9Cbring your own environment=E2=80=9D capabiliti=
es for users,
especially gateways. Singularity provides portability and reproducibility
and is designed to fit our shared resources.

The lead developer, Greg Kurtzer from LBL, will be online via Skype or a
Google Hangout during the JoF to answer questions and provide insight on
Singularity=E2=80=99s roadmap.

Please pass this on to whomever you think might be interested!

Singularity is a platform to support users that have different
environmental needs then what is provided by the resource or service
provider. While the high level perspective of other container solutions
seems to fill this niche very well, the current implementations are focused
on network service virtualization rather than application level
virtualization focused on the HPC space. Because of this, Singularity
leverages a workflow and security model that makes it a very reasonable
candidate for shared or multi-tenant HPC resources like Comet without
requiring any modifications to the scheduler or system architecture.
Additionally, all typical HPC functions can be leveraged within a
Singularity container (e.g. InfiniBand, high performance file systems,
GPUs, etc.).
