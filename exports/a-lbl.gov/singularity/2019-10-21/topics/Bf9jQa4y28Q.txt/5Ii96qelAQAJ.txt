Hi all, 

I would like to ease my deployments of Hadoop using Singularity with either 
instances or containers. 
Basicaly my goal is to deploy one instance (called master) with a YARN 
ResourceManager and a Namenode and several other intances (called slaves) 
with a DataNode and a YARN NodeManager. 
Also, it would be necessary for these instances to cohabit on the same 
physical host. 
Here is the issue I am facing: Hadoop agents communicate through IP 
addresses and default ports. Therefore it is not currently possible for a 
manager to communicate with several slaves on the same host.

Do you happen to know if their is any work around deploying Hadoop on 
several Singularity instances or containers?

Best regards,
Carla
