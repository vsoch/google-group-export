Hi all!

As a new user of a Singularity I have a question about a use case. I intend 
to package an image processing app in a Singularity container but have a 
question about communication between separate nodes for example using 
RabitMQ or to access to some remote queue. I intend to package these worker 
nodes as a Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/> workers so I need to know 
if we can connect to a remote RabbitMQ queue from the Singularity container 
to get a new batch of data to be processed from a remote queue. I intend to 
use Singularity as this nodes are computationally intensive and will be 
placed at some HPC with SLURM workload manager installed of course having 
no sudo access.

Best regards,

Dejan
