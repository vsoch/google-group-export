Okay. Maybe some of my terminology has been goofed up. Effectively what we 
want is to be able to create a propery singularity (or docker) image from 
an arbitrary chroot. I think most of this has been captured in my above 
questions, but I was goofing up what a vnfs actually is. 

I have been able to manually generate the metadata, but it would of course 
be nice if there was a way to have singularity do it, just so it's done 
properly. Similar to how you can use Singularity to properly interact with 
docker images (it will create a /.singularity.d), we'd like to have it 
properly interact with an arbitrary chroot (including converting it to a 
proper singularity image). 

As I said before, this could be something we could work on and submit some 
pull requests if you all are interested.

<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the quick reply. From reading that li=

<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1) the ability to create custom run/start script=

<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The most concerning is the &quot;action&quot; co=
