Hi,

The R / Python question is very important; we need that too. I had to
create recently a docker container for R to address a specific usage (with
all the security issues it could lead), while every other users are using
environement module for the rest of R usage. I am pretty curious about the
results you will get Chu. Please share your sapp application (sspec file) :)

By the way, I think singularity could be use in many different way/domain
(not only hpc).

Best,
Remy
