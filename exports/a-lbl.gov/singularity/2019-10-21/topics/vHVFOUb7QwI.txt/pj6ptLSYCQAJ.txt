We used to include grsec/PAX enabled kernels with Caos Linux, but we didn't=
 have it enabled aggressively by default. But I think you are right, it may=
 take some playing with in order to get the right balance of security and p=
ermission to run properly.=20

Also I'm curious if we are going to see additional issues with Ash being th=
e default shell as it is based on Busybox.

Hopefully it comes with a complete development toolchain as well.=20
