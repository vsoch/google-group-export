Use a sandbox
sudo singularity build -s someName someFile 

This will create a directory named someName using the someFile definition 
file. The capacity will be as large as the free space you have available.

You can later make a read only squashfs image out of it.

sudo singularity build anotherName someName

Although, personally, I just use the sandbox for development/prototyping 
and code everything into a definition file later.
