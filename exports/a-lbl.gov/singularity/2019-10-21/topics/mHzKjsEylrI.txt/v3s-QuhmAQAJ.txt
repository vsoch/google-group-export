Ok, so let's say (because its true) I have program that needs wine to run, 
called "myexe.exe".  Right now, I have to:

singularity exec wine myexe.exe

I'm trying to figure out the "right way" to reduce this so on my runtime 
system I just:
myexe.exe

It seems to begin with, I can create an "app" that runs "wine myexe.exe" 
from within the singularity def (easy enough).

Now, is there an "official" way to "get rid" of singularity exec in the 
command?  I assume using "alias" but is there some way to get this set up 
within the definition file itself?  Or it would need to be run by each 
individual singularity user?
