Hi Stefan,

Thanks  for letting me know about the firefox issue! I've been using let's
encrypt for the domain certificates, and the certificate was valid and
there was one setting off that (I think) would trigger a message in a few
browsers. I tried regenerating it - and it looks ok here
https://www.digicert.com/help/. Do you still see the error? If so, could
you please forward me the specific message (vso...@stanford.edu) so I can
look into the details.

If you delete the image, a new push to the repo will automatically build it
again. You can have as many builds as you like (each is a push). Some
recommendations (that will be published, but I'll post here for now):

- delete un-needed images as they take up storage, etc.
- if you are going to be doing big changes to a repo and pushing a lot,
click the button on the collection page to "disable builds." You can click
it again to re-enable when you are finished with your work.
- Use different branches for different tags of images. For example, the
image will be built automatically from master, but if you push something
else to yourrepo:otherbranch, then you will get a (different) image built
with that tag, and each would be accesible like:

singularity pull shub://myrepo/image:master (master branch)
singularity pull shub://myrepo/image:other (other branch)
singularity pull shub://myrepo/image:latest (latest across branches)

Best,

Vanessa
