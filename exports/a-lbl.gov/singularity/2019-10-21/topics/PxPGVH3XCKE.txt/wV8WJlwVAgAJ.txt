Darn. I wanted to avoid that.

As for the reason -- I have a pipeline that is made up of different 
modules. Each module is isolated inside its own container. Each image is 
actually quite small (~500 MB to 1GB). I did this because it was easier to 
maintain images for each module individually, then to put everything inside 
a single one.

Best,
Chris
