Hey Mike,

Singularity itself can handle a lot of docker registry locations - the
previous (before 3.0) had working pulls for URIs for AWS, Nvidia, and of
course Docker Hub (I haven't tried them since) but they should hopefully be
working because conforming to OCI makes this easier! The sregistry
(singularity registry global client) is also optimized to do *just* the
management commands (pull, push, inspect, mv, search, etc.) given some
remote endpoint (e.g., nvidia, aws, docker hub, google storage, etc.) There
are instructions for each of the clients here -->
https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/clients and of course if you
have any issues please open and I will help out!

So in summary:

 1. For standard docker registries, first try actions (pull, shell, etc.)
with Singularity native.
 2. For more management (e.g., you pull an image and keep it organized,
push to a non docker registry) you can try Singularity Registry Global
Client (sregistry-cli)

To take advantage of (most) cloud storage that *isn't a proper docker
registry* (aws, nvidia, Docker Hub *are) *then sregistry-cli can help you
out. The goal of the software is to allow for flexibility, because most
institutions have different kinds of storage they would put their images
in, not necessarily a proper registry.  If you *do* want a proper registry
for Singularity Images, then I'd again suggest Singularity Registry
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry> with CI to push. The (long ago
derived) goals of this was to be an open source registry that is powered by
contributions of its users.

Oh! And with a little help from the Circle crew, I got the circle-ci
example working! --> https://github.com/singularityhub/circle-ci And guess
what? This is kind of nuts, but images up to 3GB will actually be storable
as artifacts! Meaning you can use their API (you get a token) to download
them with curl. That is *really* sweet, because it's a total version
control --> build --> storage without needing any additional anything. I
wouldn't trust the storage for long term (e.g., a publication) but for
short term (while developing or otherwise) it's a really easy solution for
building without sudo. You just can't have images that are too big :)

Github just added actions too - which introduces another beautiful
opportunity for building. I signed up for beta but don't have the button
yet :)

Best,

Vanessa
