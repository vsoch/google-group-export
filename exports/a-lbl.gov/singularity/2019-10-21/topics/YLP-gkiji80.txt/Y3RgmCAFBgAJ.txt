Subject: Re: [Singularity] kernel panic after editing in sandbox

Hi Igor,

I want to expand on what David mentioned. It is very high priority for us
to make sure all features work with any pair of Linux host/container so it
does not crash the host. One of the tricks is that Singularity is doing a
few things that were not considered as commonplace just a few years ago and
as a result, some of these things end up tickling kernel bugs which are
within the distribution's kernel. We have introduced several workarounds
for various distribution's kernel bugs already but we can't always
replicate, identify or debug the root cause.

As David mentioned, this is when we create system administrator
configurables to enable or disable certain features that are known to be
problematic.

Will you be at SC? There will be several meet ups where we can discuss and
hopefully debug some of these problems.

Warmest regards,

Greg
