Hi Vanessa,

Yes, of course the point is not to become root anywhere but just to run 
code more easily available for a different OS than the one you are 
currently stuck with. The non-root installation I think would precisely 
avoid potential privilege escalation. Any manipulation of the image can be 
done on a system with root access while the image could be run on a system 
without having to use any setuid code which makes many administrators 
nervous. However, I guess that being on Centos 6.8 there is no way to 
leverage the namespace features and work totally in user space. I was 
hoping this was not the case.

Thanks,

rd
