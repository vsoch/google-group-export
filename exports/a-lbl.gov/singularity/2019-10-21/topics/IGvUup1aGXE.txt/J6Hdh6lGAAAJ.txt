Weird question, I know, given the whole point of singularity is to avoid 
this sort of thing.  We are working with a SLURM queue on an HPC that 
requires singularity containers (fair enough).  My lab does a lot of R 
processing, and there is a package called "rslurm" that, in theory, send 
jobs to the queue.  However, this R is containerized so what it is 
currently attempting to do is send jobs to the containerized SLURM (which 
does not exist). I'd like it to send commands "up a level" to the level 
where the container was executed (the user's non-singularity environment) 
so it can be executed.  Is this possible?  If so, how do I accomplish this?
