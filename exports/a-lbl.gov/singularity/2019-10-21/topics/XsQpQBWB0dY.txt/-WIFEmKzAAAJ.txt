Hey Simone,

>

>

You can have a Docker image (no Singularity in sight) that is stored on
Docker Hub as tar.gz layers. Then with Singularity you can "pull" from
Docker hub to assemble those layers into an image. Try it!

singularity pull docker://godlovedc/lolcow

For some use cases, it's easier to maintain one build recipe (a Dockerfile
in this case) and then kill two birds with one stone by having both images
available.

Or to do that I need to re-write my singularity base recipe file to docker
> one? Hope this is not the case.
> If I may ask, did you figure out why the build times out? Is it because

Yes, and unfortunately not at the moment.

If your group wants to host a singularity registry, then you can push
images to it!

https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/
