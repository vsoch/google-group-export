I think so too, and the thing that really just bugs me about putting it in
a user's home directory is the temporary mount points (e.g. /dev and /proc)
which will land there while Singularity apps are running. I've even
considered it being *non* run-time configurable cause I dislike the idea so
much. But maybe I'm simply overthinking it (I never do that....).

Anyways thanks for the feedback Remy and Tim! :)
