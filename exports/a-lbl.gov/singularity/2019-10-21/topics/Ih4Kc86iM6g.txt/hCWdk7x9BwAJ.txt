Sorry Igor,

It's a security feature.  Singularity sanitizes the path when it starts so
that a user cannot slip something silly into the $PATH and then execute it
with elevated privs.  In the past it wasn't a big deal because all
dependancies were already in those directories on your average RHEL,
CentOS, Ubuntu or what-have-you.  But now we have the added dep of
mksquashfs.

I'm thinking of writing a PR to make the location of mksquashfs
configurable in singularity.conf.  But even if Greg likes the idea and it
is merged it won't be in an official release for a little while.

Dave
