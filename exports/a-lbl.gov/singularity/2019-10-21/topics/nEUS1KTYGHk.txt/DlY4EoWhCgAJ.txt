This is really old (and should be modified before use for newer versions of
Singularity) but conceptually this idea doesn't seem too complicated - you
need to package your system (and not include various directories and the
package itself) and then dump it into a Singularity image (a folder to
build). The code here
<https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-python/blob/master/singularity/package/clone.py>
is very old (circa 2017) so I wouldn't use verbatim, but the general steps
might be something to try. It was the basis around the self bootstrap
<https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/blob/f266176d580223fe99a72e2302df12a8f61af0c9/examples/self/README.md>
for a much older version of the software - an idea I had where you could
develop and then package a node, I was fairly excited about it, but it
never really took off. I still think it could be really useful for some HPC
environment to build reproducible containers for their users :)

Here are some relevant commits for those interested
