And if anyone has networking wisdom, please share! It seems a little
mysterious to me why the timeouts started in the first place. Here is some
output of dig/whois that I created to help with debugging, if anyone has
insight: --> https://gist.github.com/vsoch/775b54e54e5e599a9f510c84475bf31c

I see something weird - I'm testing on the same computer, and for one test
I'm using Google nameservers (when Singularity Hub and pulls work) and then
the second I've commented them without. What I notice is that when I add
the nameservers, the dig returns the correct address:

35.197.63.182

...but when I remove them, it's different!

13.72.107.243

What in the world? This appears to be an ip address owned by Microsoft
<https://www.ultratools.com/tools/ipWhoisLookupResult>?

Also, if anyone needs to obtain a container on their cluster (or other
location where they cannot tweak the resolv.conf) please send me a message
and I will be happy to look up the direct download link in Google Storage
for you. I will post any updates if I hear more from Google Support - their
last message was earlier this morning.
