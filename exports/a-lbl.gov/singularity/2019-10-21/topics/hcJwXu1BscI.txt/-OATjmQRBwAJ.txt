I've though about exactly that but only superficially. Yes that would be a =
very cool feature to have a launcher that could run on OS X or other operat=
ing systems that could create a light weight emulated Linux environment and=
 run the container from there. I've heard rumors that Docker can do somethi=
ng similar and people can run Docker images on other operating systems but =
every time I've asked, it is people running it within a full VM.=20

Does anyone have more insights?
