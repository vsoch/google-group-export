I am concerned that this is a crutch for people that are not defining
optional dependencies in their bootstrap. This is obviously not a hard
dependency otherwise YUM/APT/DNF would bring them in automatically. In
Singularity v1, we had our own dependency solver so we can easily add
functionality for this type of things, but now we are relying on the
operating system's installer and dependency resolver.

It is my perspective that this needs to be handled via the bootstrap
definition file and proper documentation (which I'm still working on, sorry
everyone for the delay!).
