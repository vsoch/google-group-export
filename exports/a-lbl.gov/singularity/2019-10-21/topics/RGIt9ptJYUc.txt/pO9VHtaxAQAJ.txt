I also tried with singularity import from a docker export and I found that=
=20
the -e option is able to remove the environmental variables this time but=
=20
then variable set in the docker image are present in the final image=20
(either using the -e option or not).

docker build -t test: .
singularity create --size 400 test.img
docker create test:latest
docker export=20
0145cc477510ad0a05fda9dacfaac95b2a097679b4d2511048ddfd548105c4a3 |=20
singularity  import test.img

Thanks again,
