I can't believe I forgot to respond to this, this made me so happy
<http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/3115931/dog-dance-o.gif> this morning! :D

It's also really cool to see Singularity being used for more "non sciencey"
stuff. Not that the sciencey stuff is bad, I just like the other stuff
better :)
