uld be totally off, but I think this is an interesting idea for a a slightl=
y different reason. I'm developing singularity hub, (the singularity equiva=
lent of Docker hub) and it's going to work in a similar way - a command lin=
e tool takes some run command, looks to see if the containers are cached, a=
nd if not, pulls and runs. This kind of tool would then need different plug=
ins for easily integrating into different running environments (SLURM being=
 one of them, because you know, the other big players in the game have been=
 such great supporters of HPC *smile*). The early use case is just download=
ing one container and running it,and we wouldn't need anything very sophist=
icated for that.  @rhc - you are right, a container in this case is just an=
other executable. The later (cooler!) use case is asking to run a workflow,=
 which would have dependencies and multiple containers. In the simplest imp=
lementation, it correctly sets up the workflow, assesses the queues that th=
e user has access to, allocates correct memory and runtimes (possibly needi=
ng different queues), and then runs,and produces outputs. In a more sophist=
icated implementation, it captures different meta data about the analysis a=
nd run, and stores that somewhere (for reproducibility). For all of those o=
ut there interested in this idea of "push button HPC" from a browser, that =
could all happen from some web interface. Thus, a native SLURM plugin that =
can manage those dependencies and advanced use cases would be... super awes=
ome :)

FWIW: the PMIx community is working on a parser that will take as input a s=
cript or an executable, scan it for executables, determine the type of that=
 executable (e.g., container, binary, Java, etc), and provide a list of all=
 the library dependencies for it. This is being done to support schedulers =
so they can pre-position those dependencies, thus enabling faster startup. =
PMIx has already being integrated into many of the HPC schedulers to suppor=
t fast startup, and so this is a natural extension.

Also FWIW: there are several good HPC schedulers out there, SLURM being onl=
y one of them. Those of us working on libraries to support the community ge=
nerally try to remain RM-agnostic as they all have their pros/cons and dedi=
cated market share. Ultimately, I think Greg would like to see Singularity =
equally well supported by them all, so if we can find mechanisms that don=
=E2=80=99t require RM-specific code, that would be best.
