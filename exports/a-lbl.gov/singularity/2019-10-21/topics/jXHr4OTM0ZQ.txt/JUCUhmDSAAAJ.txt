Hi,

to be honest I don't find the behaviour of not automatically binding your 
home directory when singularity is executed with root privileges 
counterintuitive (singularity sees you as root in this case not as user 
xyz). Also, normally root is not allowed to write in user home directories 
in the case of NFS mounted home folders anyway (well, at least this is the 
case in the systems I work in) , so it wouldn't really make sense to have 
them bound into the singularity image automatically.
I don't want to make any judgements regarding the system you're working in 
(since I don't know it), but I have to second the comment from Robin that 
generally speaking giving users these kind of rights is really dangerous. 
Also, I don't understand your comment "... being given sudo privs to the 
singularity command is almost the same as being given the root password". 
Singularity gives you the same privileges inside the container that you 
have when executing it. So if you run singularity with sudo rights (which 
you should only do when making any changes to the container environment 
itself, in my opinion) you have to act with the same amount of care when 
doing anything else with sudo.

Cheers,

Thomas
