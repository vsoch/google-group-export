Hi Greg,

   Thanks for your reply. If I go with option 1, does that mean I will 
always have to run the container with the --writable option? Unfortunately 
my only use case for Singularity at the moment is to run it on an HPC 
cluster as a regular user. Or I am completely misunderstanding your 
suggestion? Thanks,

  -Ivan
