singularity 2.5.1?
To: Oliver Freyermuth <o.fre...@googlemail.com>


Hi Oliver,

I think the relevant line from above is:

> Running Singularity in any way shape or form on systems without
NO_NEW_PRIVS is not supported.  Nobody is going to be testing older
versions of the kernel for undiscovered vulnerabilities that might still
affect Singularity.

In other words we cannot ensure that the runtime checks are the relevant
checks in this case.  The runtime checks (which do also exist btw) are only
in response to the vulnerabilities we have already discovered.  Kernels
without PR_NO_NEW_PRIVS are inherently insecure for many of the operations
carried out by Singularity and those kernels are just not supported.

I don't think it is fair for you to attribute malicious intent to what you
view as an incorrect packaging decision.  But it is true that Sylabs
doesn't have any distro maintainers on staff.  The way I see it, we are
really supplying the files for rpm and deb packaging as a courtesy.  You
can look at them as a template for how you might write your own (if you
really don't want to install from source for some reason), but they
shouldn't be used as is by distro maintainers.  We've actually had some
discussions about stripping those files down, making them very basic, and
explicitly stating that they are templates provided as a courtesy and we
are not accepting PRs on them.  You've no-doubt noticed that we don't have
a lot of resources for reviewing and merging packaging-related PRs.  It's
not that we are uninterested in this, it just doesn't happen to be our main
expertise and focus.  And I think that is OK.

Dave

&gt; Hi Oliver,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Please see my explanation to Lars above on why these checks matter at =
build time. <br>
<br>
</span>which ones? <br>
The explanation I read only explained that you want to enforce people build=
ing singularity on older environments have to patch out the misplaced check=
s themselves. <br>
There was no explanation at all why the checks are done at build time inste=
ad of at the correct place, i.e. at post-install of the deb / rpm packages =
or at runtime. <br>
<br>
It seems there are common misconceptions about how packaging on Linux in ge=
neral works amongst the Singularity devs. <br>
I hope that&#39;s discussed at some point in Sylabs, including @gmk, who (a=
s one of the experienced persons from CentOS) should be able to point out t=
o the others why build-time checks for run-time functionality <br>
are *not* done for any Linux package, and if they are for the rare exceptio=
ns where upstream devs do not understand the implications, <br>
are generally patched out at distro level. <br>
<br>
If Singularity want&#39;s to make packaging harder by violating established=
 best practices, that&#39;s a statement on its own. Maybe the goal is not a=
nymore to see widespread adoptiona and enter Debian / RedHat main repositor=
ies,<br>
but to rather sell off Singularity Pro packages? <br>

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Checking for something at build time which matters =

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If you look around at Linux distros people are usin=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0For example, we build our RPMs and DEBs on the Open=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If the official statement from Sylabs is, that nobo=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0It seems there are fundamental issues with how pack=

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0That&#39;s completely unrelated to the fact that of=
