Hi,

  So, I have been testing out my registry, and I have a question about how 
the cache works with Singularity containers.  I've noticed that when 
downloading Dockerhub containers, Singularity will reuse the layers that 
were cached.  However, for Singularity container images I have downloaded 
from my internal sregistry, like my sregistry-cli container to do uploads, 
Singularity always re-downloads the container from my registry.  It doesn't 
use the version stored in the local cache.  

Is these the expected behavior for the cache?  Are there some settings I 
could change to have Singularity check the local cache first?  

We are using Singularity in a large shared compute environment, with a 
shared cache on local disk.  It would be great to take advantage of 
previously downloaded images rather than constantly downloading from the 
registry for scalability.

Thanks
-Mike
