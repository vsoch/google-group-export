I think he is talking about more of a use case to provide interactive
(container) environments based on a set of images, for example to support
different OS? E.g., the container environment is the idev node. Running the
container (from the outside) as an executable is a bit different I think. I
could be totally off, but I think this is an interesting idea for a a
slightly different reason. I'm developing singularity hub, (the singularity
equivalent of Docker hub) and it's going to work in a similar way - a
command line tool takes some run command, looks to see if the containers
are cached, and if not, pulls and runs. This kind of tool would then need
different plugins for easily integrating into different running
environments (SLURM being one of them, because you know, the other big
players in the game have been such great supporters of HPC *smile*). The
early use case is just downloading one container and running it,and we
wouldn't need anything very sophisticated for that.  @rhc - you are right,
a container in this case is just another executable. The later (cooler!)
use case is asking to run a workflow, which would have dependencies and
multiple containers. In the simplest implementation, it correctly sets up
the workflow, assesses the queues that the user has access to, allocates
correct memory and runtimes (possibly needing different queues), and then
runs,and produces outputs. In a more sophisticated implementation, it
captures different meta data about the analysis and run, and stores that
somewhere (for reproducibility). For all of those out there interested in
this idea of "push button HPC" from a browser, that could all happen from
some web interface. Thus, a native SLURM plugin that can manage those
dependencies and advanced use cases would be... super awesome :)

I think there are other potential cool ideas for having a SLURM
integration, some of which may not be stumbled upon until we dig in a bit!
The early set up, while maybe simple, will teach us things and possibly
lead us there. Thus, I think this is definitely worth exploring.
