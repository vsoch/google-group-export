Oh sorry!  I got confused about the name of my own code!  It is
gpu4singularity <https://github.com/NIH-HPC/gpu4singularity> that is
deprecated.  I can't speak to cuda4singularity because I don't really know
what that is.  Sorry for the confusion.

<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; She submits it as a PBS job including &quot;module load cuda75&quo=
