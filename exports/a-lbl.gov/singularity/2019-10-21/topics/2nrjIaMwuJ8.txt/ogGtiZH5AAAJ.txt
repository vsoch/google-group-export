We have been working with some Nvidia engineers to figure out the best path
forward here and we are planning on including a Singularity module to
handle this natively. In a nutshell, the solution as I see it will look
like:

1. look for Nvidia libraries on the host in a given set of standard
locations
2. If they exist, bind them inside of the container
3. Make sure that these libraries will be found and taken priority by the
linker

This will ensure that the libraries on the host, that match the host's
kernel modules, will be available within the applications within the
container automatically.
