Thanks for the very interesting thread!  nextflow is very interesting.

One thing that I still wonder is, how big should each of the container be?
For instance, CoreOS don't come with any package manager, and tiny
containers contain perform very specific task.  Many containers may be
strung together to perform a "not so complex task", just like one would
string several pipes together on the unix command line.

For HPC workflow, many tiny containers may not make sense?  If the goal is
to provide a single image file that contain the workflow, then this would
be a fat container, more akin to a VM than to a package?   I think the
default singularity image is 768MB, so tiny container is probably not what
was intended.

The granularity question probably don't have one fast and hard answer, but
it would be interesting to hear what container size others are building out
there, and where is the line when one say "this should go to a separate
container"?

For example, when I created a container for circos, I put gcc, gd, perl and
a slew of CPAN modules in it.  The resulting image was ~1.7GB.  Was this a
good stopping point?  If the user wanted other, say, bioinformatics tools,
they should go on a different container rather than build on top of this
one?

Cheers,
Tin
