Hi JS,

I think what you are asking for is a security issue.  In other words, a
user may be able to add an executable called python to their path and then
there is a possibility that it would be executed with elevated privs by
Singularity.  This is the reason we sanitize the path.

I know that several users experienced a similar issue with mksquashfs being
installed in a non-standard location when we released v2.4.  I have a PR
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/1094> that addresses
this issue by allowing an admin to specify the location of the mksquashfs
binary in the singularity.conf file.  I'm not sure if a similar strategy
would work in your situation or not.  Presumably you have a single
singularity installed per conda environment, so you could use this kind of
feature if it existed?

Dave
