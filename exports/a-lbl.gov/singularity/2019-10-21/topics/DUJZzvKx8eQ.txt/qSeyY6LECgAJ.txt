If Singularity has something to benefit from adopting the spec to whatever
extent that it can (integration into applications that support it) or in
that it helps to capture things like history, +1 that it wouldn't hurt to
include. There isn't much overlap between boutiques (which captures input
and outputs) and this (which captures runtime system information), but I
wonder if the two groups might talk to one another so generally we wouldn't
be sticking out fingers into multiple egg baskets :)

Greg - the URI would be very useful for Singularity Hub - right now a
"unique id" (which is just a number) is assigned to an image when it's
uploaded, but that of course would only serve to live with the image while
it lives in the Hub. We could still maintain this id (it's really just an
application table key), but have a more proper one to live with the
container.

Chris - I was rethinking our earlier conversation about workflows, and I
think starting with running a single container with inputs / outputs (a
single node workflow) would work to start, if you could direct me to a
suggested one for that! :O)

 when the container is on a network file system (especially a parallel file=
 system) as metadata lookups are expensive. For large scale parallel runs, =
it makes much more sense to use images.</div><div><br></div><div>Hopefully =
