Hi Oliver,

A lot of responses to the issues raised here have been given in the slack c=
hannel over the past couple of days. This tends to be where issues are rais=
ed by the community first, and as a a consequence, information may often ha=
ve appeared there first. I think we probably do need to be better at reachi=
ng people who are not members of the channel. There=E2=80=99s a balance to =
strike here between sending out a lot of email to the list, and making sure=
 the key points reach everyone. In my personal opinion, due to the real-tim=
e interactive nature of slack, it=E2=80=99s often easier to mention things =
there early with a view that any misunderstanding is easier to clear up tha=
n via a mailing list. Posting to a mailing list has a more final feel to it=
, and personally I=E2=80=99d be less likely to post to the list with early =
thoughts. This is my view, and others in the team may feel differently. It=
=E2=80=99s definitely an area to work on. At the February hackathon the ide=
a of community zoom video conferences was also mentioned.

Before I address your comments, I=E2=80=99d like to mention that I joined t=
he core team recently having come from an academic institution where I used=
 Singularity heavily and made contributions. I=E2=80=99m definitely aware o=
f the confusion surrounding things like git repo structure, which I felt wh=
en I was a contributor. I want to assure you that the all of the Sylabs tea=
m recognize the issues, and we are all really looking forward to working in=
 a much simpler, smoother landscape as we move toward 3.0. It=E2=80=99s rea=
lly important to us to make it easier for contributions to come in, and mak=
e it through the pipeline as new features and fixes in new releases of Sing=
ularity.

On to my personal responses to some of the things you raised...

> Leaving that aside, I would say it's already bad that 2.4.3 actually "mad=
e it out" before it was superseded by a follow-up release,=20
> which I can only interpret as=20
> "The release notes / feature changes have not been discussed in the Core =
team before the release".=20

It=E2=80=99s true that something made it out which shouldn=E2=80=99t have. =
However, it=E2=80=99s not fair to say there wasn=E2=80=99t discussion befor=
e the release. We were also able to issue a 2.4.4 quickly, thanks to a repo=
rt from a user followed by swift investigation and actions leading to a new=
 release - which I hope you'd agree demonstrates some co-ordination and res=
ponsibility. We=E2=80=99re working to have a 2.5 available soon with the wh=
iteout fixes in.

> I would recommend to copy the procedure of other successful projects, i.e=
.:

e of the key points Sylabs was founded for, I think?)

PRs are reviewed prior to merge. This is not new, should be visible to all =
on GitHub, and continues as we move toward 3.0. It has been mentioned on th=
e slack channel that there will be improvements to testing methodology to i=
mprove the review process.

> - A hint in the guidelines for the release manager on what to check befor=
e releasing (have new dependencies been added?).=20

Absolutely - of course the dependency issue is now on everyones radar with =
regard to releases.

> - Rethinking the model of branches.=20
>  Commonly, there would be something like a a 2.5.x / "next" branch receiv=
ing features for the next larger release.=20
>  In addition, a 2.4.x branch which receives features for the next point r=

As you noted later, we now have a =E2=80=98release-2.4=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98development-2.x=E2=80=99 branch - evidence that we are moving toward the=
 type of model that you mention. We are in a complex situation at present d=
ue to the ongoing Go language rewrite which targets 3.0, and the fact that =
we had a =E2=80=98development=E2=80=99 branch in existence that had diverge=
d somewhat from the release trees. We have very recently been porting back =
things from the diverged tree into =E2=80=98development-2.x=E2=80=99 to tar=
get a 2.5 release. This work should be visible via the =E2=80=982.5 milesto=
ne=E2=80=99 on the Singularity GitHub repository. We have asked for, and ha=
ve been lucky enough to receive, help from various people who have submitte=
d PRs in this effort.

> I see singularity already has a "release-2.4" branch, and "development-2.=
x", so the pattern already exists,

As above - this should be becoming more evident as we work on the next rele=
ase. We are still in a slightly complex situation due to the magnitude of t=
he go rewrite for 3.0 occurring while 2.x releases still need to be made. G=
it repo structure was a hot topic during the hackathon days, has come up on=
 the slack channel, and we are now confident we are moving to a good soluti=
on that will return us to a very clear situation as work on 3.0 progresses.

Certainly changes and releases will be reviewed and tested. It is not a goa=
l to automatically merge and release unreviewed, untested code.

I hope these answers clear things up a bit.

Cheers,

Dave Trudgian
