Hi Martin,

The first bit... The grep and return code bits... So, I don't believe that
Dash is Bash compatible, but both are Bourne compatible. That means you may
not be able to do things like $( ... ) as those are bash'isms and are not
true to 'shell'. I would change your command to be much simpler to read
like:

if env | grep -q proxy; then
   echo do something here if proxy is defined
fi

That works because if will actually evaluate the command given (in your
example, the command it is evaluating is `[`).

If you don't care if a command returns success or fail, I typically use:

/bin/false ||:

Regarding the `pip` error... I am not sure, but one thing I just changed in
the development branch is for the `/dev` tree to be mounted during
bootstrap. Not sure if that will help here (depending on what is the cause
of that error) but it was a difference between 2.2 and 2.3-development. So,
long story short, maybe try again with a recent `git pull`

Hope that helps!

Greg
