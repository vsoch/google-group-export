Hi Paolo,

I saw that you addressed this to Greg, but I've got a pretty good idea how
this works so I think I can speak (semi) intelligently on it.

The first point is that this feature has nothing to do with CUDA.  The CUDA
libraries and the NVIDIA driver libraries are two different things (though
NVIDIA muddies the waters by packaging them together).  The CUDA and cuDNN
libraries (and any other GPU programming libraries) will still need to be
installed within the container.  And that is important because, as you
point out, a specific app will need a particular version of the libraries.
But this feature will bind the underlying driver libs into the container,
allowing the CUDA libs to work.

The second point is that this FIXES application portability which is
currently broken.  Right now, if you want to run a container with GPU
support you will need to unpack the NVIDIA driver libraries into the
container and add them  to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, (or the ld.so.cache or
something).  The key is that you must anticipate the driver version that is
running on the host system where you wish to deploy your container and use
the exact same driver version when you install libraries into the
container.  This breaks portability because your container can only run on
a host system with a matching driver.  And if somebody updates the driver
you have to build a new container or shell into your existing container and
fiddle with it.  With Greg's solution the same container can be run on
hosts with different drivers.  This fixes portability.

The only thing that will not work with this scheme is if you have a host
system with an outdated driver and you try to run a container with the
latest greatest CUDA installed in it.  That ain't gonna work.  But I have
no idea how you could make that work.  The NVIDIA driver installs kernel
modules.  So unless we are going to start running containers with their own
kernels (VMs) I don't see how to make this solution any more portable.
