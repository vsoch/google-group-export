Hello,

I have been reading through the Singularity documentation planning to 
compile from source and load via Module. From reading the documentation and 
some of the past posts on this list I had a some questions. 

In the documentation I came across this for the --localstatedir option 
(http://singularity.lbl.gov/admin-guide#prefix-in-special-places-localstatedir):

You may also experience issues if this directory is shared between several 
hosts/nodes that might run Singularity simultaneously.

From this it seems like my idea of using Singularity and Modules would not 
be a proper implementation. I have read other posts where this is referring 
to NFS shares so would this warning be applicable to installation on GPFS 
mounts as well?

The documentation also prefers that Singularity is installed directly on 
the hosts via RPM. Is loading Singularity via Module something to be 
avoided?

Otherwise any tips or things I should consider would also be appreciated. 

Thanks!
