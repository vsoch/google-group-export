Hi Rd,

With the development branch, you don't need sudo to create a container or
import, eg:

singularity create container.img
> singularity import container.img docker://centos:7


Singularity supports building containers into directories, if you want to
test things out, for example, but it must be done with bootstrap (which
requires sudo)

mkdir container
> sudo singularity bootstrap container Singularity


where Singularity is the bootstrap definition file.

If you could provide more information about your use case, I'd be glad to
help. Generally I wouldn't recommend building into a directory, but instead
creating a container proper, and then mounting it to see inside (like a
folder). We have docs that aren't published yet, see:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/blob/docs/2.3/pages/docs/user-docs/docs-create-an-image.md#mounting-an-image

Best,

Vanessa
