When I try to run singularity inside of singularity, I get an error:

$ singularity run shub://singularityhub/hello-world
Progress |===================================| 100.0% 
ERROR  : Failed invoking the NEWUSER namespace runtime: Operation not 
permitted
ABORT  : Retval = 255

This is probably expected, but I'm curious to know why this is happening 
(probably singularity in the container isn't owned by root). 

One possible solution is to bind mount the host singularity, but this 
presents its own challenges.
