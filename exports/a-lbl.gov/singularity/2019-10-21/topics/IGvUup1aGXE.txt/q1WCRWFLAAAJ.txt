Vanessa:

Thanks!  Is there something I have to do to specify the host environment in 
a definition when building an image?  How do I specify the path to host 
commands?

When I "which" squeue/sbatch (which is NOT in the container, rather, on the 
host running singularity):

which: no sbatch in 
(/opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/bin:/opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin)
Singularity r-base-3.4.3.simg:/pathto/> 

It is only searching within the container's environment, it appears.
