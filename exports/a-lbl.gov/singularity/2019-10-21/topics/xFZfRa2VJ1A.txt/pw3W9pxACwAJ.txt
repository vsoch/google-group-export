I am concerned about application management.  Users may use any combination 
of the "packages" I create and I don't (think) I want to provide a "full" 
container for each combination.

Consider that I have (for example only):  CentOS + Qt + MyApplication_V1

Later, I want to deploy a new version of MyApplication_V2, but *still allow 
access to* MyApplication_V1.

I *think* I would like a container containing CentOS another containing Qt 
and another containing my MyApplication_Vx *plus* a link to the other 
containers.  That way "MyApplication" container would be only as big as my 
application.

Is this something that is supported or possible.  Or am I using Singularity 
incorrectly?  As a side question, do I need an OS in my container when I 
can promise that every host will have the OS that is needed?

Thanks for any advice,


Robert
