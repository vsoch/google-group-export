For those of you in Salt Lake City, don't forget this morning's awesomeness!

http://singularity.lbl.gov/2016-sc-birds-of-feather

And if you are not in SC, is there any interest in being present virtually?
I can easily start up a Zoom video conference and post the coordinates
publicly so everyone can be part of it! Granted I'm not sure what the
format will be (e.g. lots of group discussions or a big round table) but
I'd love to include as many people as possible. It will be at 10am SLC
time, show of hands?

Thanks!
