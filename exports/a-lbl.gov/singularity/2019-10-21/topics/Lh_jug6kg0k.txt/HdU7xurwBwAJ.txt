So the test we ran was just examining the runtimes of the individual tasks 
in a Shrimp workflow when that workflow was ran using Docker, or 
Singularity, or Native. Carlos has a github repo of some code, which might 
be better for your case, since it probably doesn't rely on workflow 
software. 

Here's the github repo for using our workflow and shrimp: 
https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/makeflow-examples/tree/master/shrimp, 
in case you're interested. Our tools have options of specifying singularity 
or docker as well, which is how we integerated them.
