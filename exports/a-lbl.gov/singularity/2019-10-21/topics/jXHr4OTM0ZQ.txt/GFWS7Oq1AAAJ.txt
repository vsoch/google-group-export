I would say whoever gave you sudo privs to run singularity on a system with 
a shared NFS home directory is the one who did something wrong.  Because as 
you noted, at that point you can mount anyone's home directory and destroy 
their data.

This is, IMO, one of the challenges with singularity.  Users need to build 
their container on a system where they have root and unless they are a 
sysadmin, users shouldn't be given root on systems with shared home 
directories (NFS, GPFS, Lustre, etc.)
