Ok.  I found my problem.

We are setting up two sregistry servers for our internal HPC environments.  
I had two registry keys in the same ~/.sregistry file, but I was missing a 
"," between records.  That is what was causing this issue.  I think the 
CentOS 7 system I was running on did not have the bad .sregistry file.  
Fixing the typo resolved the issue.

DT,  thanks for the help.
