I don=E2=80=99t think it has be a Docker author, but an experienced Docker =
administrator who=E2=80=99s tried it out in HPC is the minimum requirement.=
 There are some folks at Purdue that might fit the bill [1].

I=E2=80=99ll point out that the panelists don=E2=80=99t have to be submitte=
rs or leads on the BoF but having a solid panel is necessary. In fact, the =
panel format isn=E2=80=99t even necessary though I might go with something =
very similar for this:

 * A site that is familiar with Docker in HPC
 * A site that is familiar with Singularity in HPC
 * A Docker maintainer or admin (optional, but ideal)
 * Greg

The format would be 10 minutes from the Docker view, 10 minutes from the Si=
ngularity view, and the get the audience going with prewritten questions if=
 the audience is quiet.

I recommend submitters from one or more large sites (DOE, NFS, or campus) s=
upporting a diverse mix of jobs and users where containers are of interest.=
 I=E2=80=99m not much help at this point myself, though I would share our s=
ubmission for SC15=E2=80=99s clouds and virtualization BoF with whomever ta=
kes this on.
