Can you please verify the following:

- you have issued the command pip uninstall sregistry many times until you
see that it isn't installed
- you have issued the command pip uninstall spython many times until you
see that it isn't installed
- you have install sregistry from the branch here
https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry-cli/pull/104 and this means
updating spython to 0.0.23
- sregistry is version 0.0.79
- spython is version 0.0.23
- docker-compose logs uwsgi does not show any obvious error

The screen output shows that inspect is working, but the error suggests
that the change I made was not made - the error is saying that the metedata
is None, and it is not possible now for that function to return None. I
think you likely have more than one version of sregistry installed (notice
the executable in /usr/local/bin/sregistry) or the same for spython. If you
have and use the update, I believe this should work.

Thank you!

<br>
I hav a requirement to install a local singularity hub portal for local off=
ice internal use only.=C2=A0 I have installed one to a host on the local la=
n, eg:<a href=3D"http://shub.local.net" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">=
http://shub.local.net</a>=C2=A0 I can login into it via twitter auth, creat=
e users and the rest of the web ui works ok.=C2=A0 I just cannot get a clie=
nt to push an image up to a collection.. I have gone through the documentat=
ion online and i must have missed something or not understood something, bu=
t when i run sregistry from the singularity-pyhon option, I get a KeyError:=
&#39;username&#39;<br>
<br>
any ideas anyone? or recommended simplest method to allow for users to push=
 singularity images into the internal singularity hub?<br>
<br>
Or maybe i am reading the wrong client info?<br>
<br>
any advice on getting an internal hub configured would be much appreciated<=
