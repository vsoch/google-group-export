We're still trying to get a definition file working "right" (see my latest 
post) but we are seeing a promising lead by simply mapping the slurm 
commands to an ssh remote execution command, e.g.:

  alias squeue="ssh $USER@$HOSTNAME squeue"

As long as you setup ssh keypairs, and your host system allows this, this 
will work.  

I'm trying to get this formalized in a definition file.  Any suggestions 
would be welcome.
