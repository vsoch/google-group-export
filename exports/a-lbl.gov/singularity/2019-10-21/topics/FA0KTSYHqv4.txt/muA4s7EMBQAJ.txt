Hi Reid,

Looking into OSI approval is a good suggestion, I will follow up on that.

Additionally, I can just hope that the user's interpretation and
understanding of the license is inline with the intent of the license. So
far there hasn't been a problem for mine or other open source LBNL projects
that I know about, so I'll stay optimistic... <crosses fingers and knocks
on wood>

Thanks again for the thoughts!
