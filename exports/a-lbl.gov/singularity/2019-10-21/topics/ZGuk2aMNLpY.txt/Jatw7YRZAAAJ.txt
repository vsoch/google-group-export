Hi Martin,

 unfortunately I created these containers by trial and error using latest 
ubuntu and a ppa which offers a variety of wine versions.
I didn't make the effort to create def files for those since each app needs 
some fiddling anyways.
You cannot really expect it to be anything close to a "windows" container 
where you can run and install a bunch of applications without interference.
For that purpose I'd rather stick to VMs plus native windows.
But if you want to run one specific win application in isolation and it 
reportedly works with *some* wine version, your chances are imo better to 
make it work inside a container than on your linux host. That's where I'd 
see the advantage of this approach.

Out of curiousity, what apps are you having in mind there?

Stefan
