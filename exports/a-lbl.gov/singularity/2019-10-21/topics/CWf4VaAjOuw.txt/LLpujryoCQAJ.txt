Thank you!

So that means the container adheres to the host OS flags that it is 
"running" on

<br>&gt; I have a fundamental question on how the Singularity containers wo=
rk
<br>&gt; with respect to OS kernel settings.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; Say for example the container was &quot;built&quot; on a system wi=
th RHEL kernel
<br>&gt; which had certain kernel settings disabled (e.g. Transparent Huge =
Pages
<br>&gt; ,=C2=A0 cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_<wbr>hugepage/enabled --&gt=
; never)
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; Now when this container is &quot;run&quot; on a system with Host O=
S which has
<br>&gt; those kernel settings enabled (e.g. Transparent Huge Pages,=C2=A0 =
cat
<br>&gt; /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_<wbr>hugepage/enabled --&gt; always)
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; Will the container use the Host OS kernel settings on where it is =
run or
<br>&gt; the OS settings it was &quot;built&quot; on? If latter is it possi=
ble to enforce
<br>&gt; the container to use the Host OS kernel setting on where it is run=
?
<br>&gt;=20
