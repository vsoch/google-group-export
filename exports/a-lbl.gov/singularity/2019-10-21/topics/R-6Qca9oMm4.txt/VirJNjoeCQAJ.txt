Subject: Re: [Singularity] Any Experience Using Singularity with AWS clusters?

A good place to start (and helpful for the larger Singularity user base)
might be to make a packer builder
<https://www.packer.io/docs/command-line/build.html> to deploy a
Singularity instance. I currently use this to build and send images to
Google Storage, however it would be great to have a builder that just
installs the current (or some variable defined) version of Singularity
across Google, AWS, etc. Check out the base repo here
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-builder> - would love your
contribution for a simple builder to install singularity! Check out the
docs linked above to see what you need, and my repo for an example. It
comes down to a json file to include all the specifications for the build
across cloud platforms, and then some shell (or other) file to run when the
instance starts up. Would love if you would want to give it a go and
contribute to the repo! We can move the current files into a folder called
"singularity-hub-builder" and then the one you develop into
"singularity-builder".  And glad to help if you run into issues or have
questions! This was the first time I used packer, and I liked it immensely
for how easy it was.
