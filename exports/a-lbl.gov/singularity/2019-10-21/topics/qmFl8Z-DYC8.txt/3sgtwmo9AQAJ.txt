It was possible, I don't know if it is anymore. Back around Singularity 
2.2.1, you could call singularity inside of a running singularity 
container, but the base container had to be running as root, and also 
needed to have singularity installed on it separately. So yes, it's 
possible, but it's a lot of work, and violates the core promise of not 
needing to be root to run singularity.
