Hey Vanessa,

 > Right now we store every image built, one image associated with each 
commit. It's in Google Storage, which is a highly available and backed 
up object store. Yes, we are paying for every file, haha.

Sounds expensive. And, if working with a local registry, it means we'll 
have store the images locally. Which, with CUDA-images, are about 4GB each.

 > A registry by default must build and store the image, and that 
include the build spec file too. If someone just wanted to store the 
build spec, Github is already good for that :) That's also the reason we 
use Github for version control... it's really good at that.

I forgot that you're also building everything on shub. That makes sense, 
of course.

 > With singularity inspect --defile you can see the spec file via 
inside the container., When you build  on Singularity Hub it's also 
stored in the repo, and another copy is stored in the cloud. For a local 
registry we would take a similar approach in also storing the file 
outside of the image if it's ever the case the user can't use inspect.

Perfect.


 > Right now the plan is to have Singularity Hub also trigger to build 
(final) versions of images. What I mean is that, for registries, they 
will build and store locally, and on success send the equivalent build 
to shub to do. However, since we don't have Github involved, the build 
will be associated with either the latest tag or the one that the 
builder has specified. This will give some assurance that an up to date 
image is available if the local registry goes offline, and importantly, 
if the local registry can't give outside users direct access to their 
images, the images are still known (and usable) via singularity hub.

What happens if you have to build an image containing some 
possibly-proprietary code if it's automatically published to shub?


 >> 4) Some sort of shub/sregistry script extracting package versions 
etc. sounds far too unwieldy and brittle to implement.
 > I'm not sure what you mean by this?

Some script going through the definition file, looking for packages to 
be installed, and setting their version explicitly. For example, if 
you'd use "apt-get install git", it would (on being built) check the 
current version of git and replace it with an "apt-get install 
git:1:2.13.0".
Again, far too easy to break, far too unwieldy, and extremely brittle.

 > I assume you build on a cluster resource? How are you namespacing 
/versioning the images?

In a very low-tech way. I've not yet finished the full documentation, 
but on export you specify an image on a fileserver (by path), whose 
deffile is then extracted and stored in your experiment folder. By 
default, the start script in there doesn't need an image file, but 
re-bootstraps the image using the deffile. If you do specify an image 
file, it will use that instead.
Again, very low-tech, and you can probably break a few things by 
specifying the wrong image. On the other hand, it's very easy for me to 
implement, allows sharing between users, and I can ensure that it will 
work no matter the system and state.
Worst case, you have to edit the Singularity deffile to specify the 
packages to use if you do that a year later or so.

Frederik
