Hi Aaron,
When you follow the default instructions this is what happens:
- after running "vagrant ssh" you will be located in a user directory 
inside the vagrant VM , which I believe is '''/home/vagrant'''
- the image you create, and the tar.gz you make out of it are saved to your 
current directory which is at the '''/home/vagrant''' path
- this directory is not visible from outside the vagrant VM  ("in Windows")
There is a way to do what you want:
- with default settings there is one directory that is visible from both 
windows (outside vagrant) and inside the vagrant VM:
   lets assume you started in this directory 
'''\Users\aaron\singularity-2.4''', in windows before running "ssh vagrant"
   then after entering the VM, with "ssh vagrant":
   checking your current directory (with pwd) will show you:  
'''/home/vagrant/'''
   but you can navigate to this directory:  '''cd /vagrant'''
   and you will see there the same files that were in windows in your ''' 
\Users\aaron\singularity-2.4 directory'''
- in other words there is one windows directory 
('''\Users\aaron\singularity-2.4''') which is mounted inside the vagrant VM 
('''/vagrant''')
- so what you need to do, inside the vagrant VM is:
  '''mv /home/vagrant/micca.img.tar.gz /vagrant'''
- then exiting the VM and back in windows, you should see your tar.gz file 
in your  '''\Users\aaron\singularity-2.4''' directory

I hope this helps ? Sorry if there are some inaccuracies. I don't have a 
windows machine with me right now so writing this from memory. Let me know 
if there is any problem with this.Thanks!
