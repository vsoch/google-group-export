I should mention, that I've been brainstorming this for a bit. That doesn't
mean that I have a leg up on this, but maybe just added biased. so what
I've been thinking is something like (and yes, I know it goes back to
looking somewhat RPM like):

%NAME string
... maybe other metadata

%SETUP (this may not be necessary)

%BASEIMG (instead of bootstrap, start from another image located at URI)

%BOOTSTRAP (optional parameters like mirror URL, dist type)
coreutils
yum
python
R
... (list of packages to bootstrap)

%BUILDSCRIPT (this in theory could also replace baseimg, and/or bootstrap)
#!/bin/sh
echo script to do whatever we want to create the container root
...

%POSTSCRIPT (do this after the build root has been created)
#!/bin/sh
....

%FILES (optional parameter to define which files from the buildroot to
include in the container.. Default will be everything)
/*
...

%HOSTFILES (optional list of files that exist on the host to always include
in the container
~/bin/my_script.py /usr/local/bin/my_script.py
...


%CHANGELOG
...
