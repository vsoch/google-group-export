FWIW....

I was flipping between 2.2 and head and had better mileage in "sudo make
uninstall" if i switch back to the original branch's Makefile before
running the command.   I didn't check if all files were removed, but a
subsequent git checkout master and make produced binaries that works and
don't complain about missing symbols/libraries.
