Dave,

I haven't wanted to contact anyone just yet because I don't think I'm
quite up to speed, and because I offered to 'help out' but not really
to take the lead on anything.  I am hoping someone else can lead, and
I can be a trusty sidekick for some of the more mundane tasks, thus
all of my communication so far has been with Greg and really only
about the spec file itself and whether basic tests of the resulting
.rpm work.
