Divyam,

We have successfully used Parrot mounts here for a similar purpose=20
(mounting the CERN VM file system, cernvmfs) in our Singularity images. See=
=20
below for a message on this from Eric Rees at TTU.

I=E2=80=99d appreciate any feedback from anyone who tries this.

Hi all,
=20
Correct, we use a singularity container that essentially installs Parrot=20
from =E2=80=98cctools=E2=80=99 (http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/parrot/) and=
 then in the=20
%environment just sets up HTTP_PROXY and these two variables:
=20
export PARROT_CVMFS_REPO=3D"<default-repositories>"
export PARROT_ALLOW_SWITCHING_CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=3Dyes
=20
Then the %runscript intervenes and pushes whatever commands they run=20
through parrot_run or launches parrot_run interactively if the container is=
=20
run that way:
=20
%runscript
        #Run the commands passed by the user outside the container.
        if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
                parrot_run bash --noprofile --norc
        else
                parrot_run "$@"
        fi
        exit
=20
The final exit is there to help users not have to =E2=80=9Cexit=E2=80=9D tw=
ice once they=20
finish running their code.
=20
This solution let us mount CVMFS via a container without having to rely on=
=20
FUSE.
=20
Hope this helps!
