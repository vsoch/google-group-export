Hi,

I was reading the thread about "Singularity and HPC support" and was
thinking about major improvement that could be added to singularity. The
fist post tried to compare singularity with pure container solutions. In my
opinion, one of the best advantage of docker is its docker hub /
repositories and the versioning. You could just clone a container and run
what you need (if you trust the author (signed/not signed...)). You could
also use private repositories to keep your IT infrastructure up to date and
resilient with docker containers and dockerfiles.

If you compare singularity to more classical package solution like rpm or
deb, remember that there is also repositories for these packages.

As we are talking about packages that could be imported between distros,
what do you think about creating a "singularity share place" on github or
another place in first time ?

// Maybe it is too soon for that as the singularity code evolved a lot
recently.

Best,

Remy
