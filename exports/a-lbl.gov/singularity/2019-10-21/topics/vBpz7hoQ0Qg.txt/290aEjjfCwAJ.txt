Hi Brian,

It looks like I do. The running kernel (elrepo 3.10 kernel-lt for CentoOS
6) has

CONFIG_PROC_PID_CPUSET=3Dy
CONFIG_PID_NS=3Dy
=20

I have compiled Singularity against this kernel so it should have detected
the namespace support level and it might use them?

SIGKILL somehow has no effect on these stale processes when I do kill on
them interactively either.
