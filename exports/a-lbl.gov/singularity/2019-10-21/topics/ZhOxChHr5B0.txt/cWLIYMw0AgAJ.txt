<br>=C2=A0 So... from my reading of that, you&#39;re checking the STAR sour=
ce out,
<br>into the ompi clone, as you&#39;re never changing from the ompi
<br>directory....
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 I&#39;m guessing that path is: =C2=A0/root/ompi/STAR
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 You are also not doing a &quot;make install&quot; after STAR is =
built... so
<br>the STAR binary is probably just sitting in the STAR source
<br>directory...

<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey M Noon,
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It&#39;s telling you STAR already exists, which tells=
 me that you are
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trying
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to bootstrap again (on a failed image) without re-cre=
ating the image.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Generally when you try things for a second time, you =
want to start with
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; new image, because the git clone is going to fail whe=
n it sees the old
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; STAR
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; directory is already there.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best,
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi team,
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am in the stage of getting familiarized wit=
h Singularity and don&#39;t
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know many details about it. I am trying to bu=
ild a container with MPI
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; libraries and genome aligner (STAR) that coul=
d be tested on HPC.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After facing many errors, I succeeded to inst=
all both MPI libraries
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; STAR. I am using Centos7. I am git-cloning bo=
th tools within %POST.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Logically, both programs/executables should b=
e at &quot;/usr/local/bin&quot;.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I do see mpi and it can be invoked when=
 I am in shell mode.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; great deal of efforts I couldn&#39;t find STA=
R executable or any folder
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was/should have been cloned within the contai=
ner. I may be missing
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very trivial but I can&#39;t seem to work it =
out yet.
