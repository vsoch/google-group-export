Thanks for your inputs. So there is no way to get "internet access" inside
Singularity container to access remote Queue which makes it quite unusable
for our task. We don't have time/resources to develop the Singularity :(.
Another problem is that the nodes would have to be running constantly and
listening for new jobs in a queue. Continuously restarting the node for
each request would be inefficient as we are using deep learning models that
are heavy by their design and loading the architecture again and again on
the GPU would be time consuming. Docker + Kubernetes is ideal but we only
have access to multiple GPUs on some HPC cluster currently.

Best,

Dejan

What you could try is starting container instances that use a (shared) netw=
ork (localhost) and maybe have them operate at different ports?<div><br></d=
iv><div>Just curious - what is your strategy for the layer between the web =
application and the GPU servers? These kind of connections (to a shared res=
ource with sensitive data and what not) historically can make some nervous =
:P</div><div><br></div><div>I think what you are saying is:</div><div><br><=
/div><div>=C2=A01. user requests task on front end</div><div>=C2=A02. front=
 end handles authentication and authorization</div><div>=C2=A03. front end =
submits job to celery</div><div>=C2=A04. celery task is a Singularity conta=
iner running on GPU, and since worker =3D=3D container, it requires network=
ing</div><div><br></div><div>and what I&#39;m suggesting is to separate the=
 front / back servers a bit more:</div><div><br></div><div><div>=C2=A01. us=

cation and authorization</div><div>=C2=A03. front end submits job to celery=
 (still frontend)</div><div>=C2=A04. celery worker(still frontend) is a pro=
cess that finishes configuration of job (memory? time? cluster? queue type?=
) and sends job to a back end queue (slurm, sge)</div><div>=C2=A05. the slu=
rm/sge queues are optimized for this sort of thing, so you just load the si=
ngularity module, run the job, and send a signal back to the front end queu=
e.</div></div><div><br></div><div>So a few notes on the above:</div><div>=
=C2=A0- there is flexibility (step 4) to have different kinds of queues in =
different locations. The front end worker is the manager of where things go=
.</div><div>=C2=A0- the singularity container is not required to have a net=
work, or be constantly running.</div><div>=C2=A0- the main server (the same=
 celery workers) also need a means to receive messages of something finishi=

 ideally you could manage slurm or sge with an API.</div><div><br></div><di=
v>I think there are two general recipes you can follow here. If you go the =
&quot;old school HPC route&quot; then you would do something like the above=
. You don&#39;t have a container cluster, you have standard job managers an=
d tools that communicate to them.=C2=A0 If you go the &quot;container clust=
er&quot; route then what would be needed is to have orchestration defined f=
or Singularity, and even better integration with Kubernetes. Several have t=
alked about this but I don&#39;t see any code yet :) It&#39;s a bit of a ca=
tch 22, because you could just use Docker for the second, but wait you can&=
#39;t because Docker + HPC =3D death. You could just use HPC technology for=
 the first but wait you can&#39;t, because that&#39;s not going to plug in =
easily in environments outside of HPC. So your choices are to help make Sin=
gularity more enterprise/cloudy to integrate into container clusters, or to=
 imagine if a more HPC-centric method could be adopted in different environ=
ments. I think generally connecting protected clusters to the outside world=
 is a hard problem, take a look at Agave --&gt;=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://git=
