Hi Igor,

In 2.0 there was no configuration file, now there is in Singularity 2.1 and
as you discovered it must be root owned.

The shell function is configurable via the --shell option. By default (at
present) it is /bin/sh. As you noticed, it moved a bit as we were trying to
find the correct balance between functionality, works as expected, and not
let the host's login scripts break containers (e.g. what was happening with
some things like environment modules being declared in dot files).
Specifying a simple /bin/sh by default seems to be the best solution.

Sorry for the changes, but the code is developing quickly and as it
develops it is maturing. :)

Thanks!
