Hello,

I have been able to build some simple singularity img files just importing 
from docker hub on my windows pc via vagrant... e.g. 
sudo singularity build --writable drvm.img docker://990210oliver/drvm
sudo singularity image.export drvm.img | gzip -9 > drvm.tar.gz
mv drvm.tar.gz /vagrant/

Being able to compress the images is nice for faster transfer to various 
clusters. The problem comes when I try to uncompress the archive.
tar -xzvf drvm.tar.gz 
extracts what appears to be the entire file system of the image to my home 
directory on the cluster... not what I want.
tar -xzvf drvm.tar.gz drvm.img
gives the following error... tar: drvm.img: Not found in archive
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

I have been able to test drive the .img if I transfer it uncompressed using 
singularity shell so I don't think there is anything wrong with the 
container, maybe just a problem with my tar command or and/or my 
understanding of containers?
