Hi,

I would like to run a workflow that involves several applications running 
within a Singularity container. My question is if there is a way to 
"compose" a Singularity container from several Docker containers or, more 
generally which is the recommended way to deal with this case.

To be more specific, let say I have applications A and B which I can 
docker-pull from some registry. These applications are independent (so 
building does not require the other). I would like to build a workflow 
where A's output is used as B's input. Or, maybe slightly more complex, 
where A calls B as an external program.

One option would be to build a Docker image containing A and B, but this 
imposes some restrictions, such as the docker base image being the same for 
the two apps. Is this the recommended way? Or should I build one 
Singularity container per Docker container and then find a way to combine 
them in the host?

Thanks in advance!

Ivan
