Heya Josep,

Sorry.  I see the bug fix, but if we are doing due diligence we would have
to include this bug fix, create a release candidate 3 and then put it in
code freeze and solicit testing a 3rd time to get that into 3.0.3.  A lot
of people are depending on some critical bug fixes that are already slated
for 3.0.3, so I don't think it's a good idea to delay the release any
further.  The good news is that 3.1.0 should be just around the corner.  So
hopefully you will not have to wait too long for the fix.

Hi V,

This release is not technically a security release, so I think it's just
fine to release it as soon as possible and let folks install it as they can=
.

Thanks to both of you for the heads up!
