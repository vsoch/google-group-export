When you say "names incorporated", I'm assuming that you are referring the
the 3rd clause that references LBNL specifically. I can request that we use
the standard 3 clause BSD wording but I would need some form of
justification to make the case with legals.

As I mentioned, in my experience, I make this voluntary by the contributor
and people would usually throw their names into the headers of the source
code in question as they feel appropriate. Are you suggesting that this
should be mandated and/or we should maintain a COPYRIGHT file that
enumerates each copyright holder in addition to the relevant source files?

Thanks!
