Hi Chistophe,

first, (not sure, but) I think PMIx 3 is only supported by OpenMPI 4. I did
not check the combination you are referring, so I cannot give you more
details. Please, check the exact versions (with PATCH_VERSION) of
OpenMPI/PMIx with the PMIx compatibility matrix.

In the other hand, the hybrid approach is for distributed multinode jobs.
If you are going to run single-node jobs you can run safely `mpirun` from
inside the container.

Hope it helps!
V=C3=ADctor
