Indeed, but there is also some confusing overlap with the Docker Vs
Singularity nomenclature.

In those examples it seems that Docker run uses ENTRYPOINT as the process
is called like a shell. So in Singularity terms /bin/sh is the default
ENTRYPOINT for the 'shell' command (in fact more pedantically it is the
true entry point for all commands as it is used by system() and execv*()).
But it seems as though an equivalent for Singularity would be to use
/entrypoint when calling 'shell'.

Singularity 'run' on the other hand (not being functionally equivalent to
'docker run') seems to be most closely related to the dockerfile CMD.

If I am misreading can someone correct me please.

Is that the time it takes to build and cache the image from the registry
perhaps? Certainly it can't take that long to create and tear down the
namespaces! ... I hope ...
