Hello all,

I'm trying to find some documentation on what -S/--scratch and -W/--workdir flags 
for run/exec actually do.

I don't think they are ever mentioned in the online documentation. The 
usage hints are pretty laconic:

    -S/--scratch <path> Include a scratch directory within the container 
> that is linked to a temporary dir (use -W to force location)
>     -W/--workdir        Working directory to be used for /tmp, /var/tmp 
> and $HOME (if -c/--contain was also used)


Can someone knowledgeable explain more fully what those do? With a short 
usage example, if possible.

Should an issue be raised about lack of documentation (and if yes, in which 
repo - the website one)?

Regards,
Alexander.
