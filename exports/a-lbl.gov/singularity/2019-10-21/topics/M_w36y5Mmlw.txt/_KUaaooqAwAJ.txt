So, in regards to nested containers, can I indeed have a container w/in a=
=20
container and run them via singularity? Meaning, Singularity is installed=
=20
on the host and also in the first container, and then run the app in the=20
second level container from the top level container?

Regards,
Jai

<br>Yes, I&#39;d forgotten about some of the other things like that which m=

<br>have been appropriate to mention. =C2=A0I don&#39;t know much about the=

<br>seems from discussion I&#39;ve seen that flatpak is only for graphical

<br>
<br>There are clearly too many of these things...
<br>
<br>The crucial general point of comparison from my point of view is how th=

<br>
<br>I&#39;d be inclined to write generally in terms of separate concerns:
