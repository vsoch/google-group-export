I'd like to install a javascript app thats build with the Meteor framework.
When the app starts it updates all components in user-space and aborts=20
if you're root. Since we don't have internet on the cluster I have to do=20
this=20
update thing in the bootstrap process (%post), which is run as root. That=
=20
means I
have to switch to a user somehow.=20
That we're offline just complicates everything for me. Hope this was=20
understandable.
