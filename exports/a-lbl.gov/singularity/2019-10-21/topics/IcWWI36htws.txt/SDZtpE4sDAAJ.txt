Howdy, container enthusiasts!

The Singularity 3.4.2 release has now been posted at: 
https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.4.2

This is the v3.4.1 bugfix release of Singularity, which addresses 
non-security related issues that were found in v3.4.1. We recommend you 
update to v3.4.2 for improved stability.


This release addresses the following issues:

   - Sets workable permissions on OCI -> sandbox rootless builds
   - Fallback correctly to user namespace for non setuid installation
   - Correctly handle the starter-suid binary for non-root installs
   - Creates CACHEDIR if it doesn't exist
   - Sets apex loglevel for umoci to match singularity loglevel

Thanks to our contributors
