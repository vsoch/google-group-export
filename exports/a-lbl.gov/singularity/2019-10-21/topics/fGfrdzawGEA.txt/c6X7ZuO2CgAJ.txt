Hello Dave,

yes, your suggestion makes perfect sense and the workaround should take=20
care of the problem completely. I can see drawbacks in the complexity of=20
the resulting recipe and the size of the resulting image, but you can't=20
have your cake and eat it too. The alternative is to just build without=20
support for any instruction set extension, but that also comes at a price.

Best,
Massimiliano
