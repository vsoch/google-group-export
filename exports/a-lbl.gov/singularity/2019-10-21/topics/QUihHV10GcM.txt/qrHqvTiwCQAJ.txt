Hello,

I'd like to bind-mount a large directory tree into a singularity and have 
this run as the read-only, lower
portion of an overlay file system.  The read-write, upper portion of the 
overlay - where the changes
would be made - would be held elsewhere.

Originally, I tried to do this using --bind and --overlay flags but this 
didn't work.  I posted a message
describing my situation.  Since then, I've tried another approach, which is 
to form an overlay file
system on my own:

        $ sudo singularity shell --bind /path/to/large/tree:/data:ro  
MyImage.simg

        Singularity MyImage:/> mkdir /tmp/work /tmp/overlay
        Singularity MyImage:/> mount -t overlay -o 
lowerdir=/data,upperdir=/tmp/hacks,workdir=/tmp/work none /tmp/overlay

This works.  I can create new files, edit files, etc, inside the 
container's /data directory.  I haven't figured out
where the changes are being written, however.  (I'm new to singularity and 
I'm not seeing this info in
the documentation; I'll have to open up the source code... unless someone 
wants to tell me a command
I can use to find where the data is going.)

Besides the missing data, there is another problem.  I don't want to run 
the container with sudo.  I tried adding
a simple setuid shell script to my recipe file:

        %setup
               cp /path/to/script  /etc/mount-overlay
               chmod a+x /etc/mount-overlay
               chmod u+s /etc/mount-overlay

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work.  Calling the mount command 
directly does work, however.
(I need to add some extra debugging capabilities to my script, obviously.)

I'm probably breaking all sorts of rules and I'm happy to receive 
instruction how to do this properly.  But,
this solves a rather thorny problem for me: how to get shared access to a 
large amount of data.

Thanks,

David
