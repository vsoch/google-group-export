Ok. Of course, this means you have to install (and use) Singularity in "setuid root" mode, which means essentially that (parts of) the code will run with
full root privileges. 
That's why the filesystem on which the binary is stored on must allow to set the suid bit.

For CentOS 7.4, yes, since RedHat decided to still disable user namespace support by default. So a Kernel cmdline parameter and a sysctl flag is needed to turn it on. 
On CentOS 7.4, that's the only way to run Singularity without involving implicit root privileges (due to the Singularity binary being executed with suid root). 
Each site admin has to consider the probability of potential security issues in the Kernel (enabled by activating user namespace support) versus the probability of security issues in Singularity
(which would allow to get root if the suid root status is exploited). 
I think there's no definitive answer what is better, but for sure Singularity offers more functionality in suid root mode.

Understood ;-). I'll wait for his response on the list, then.
