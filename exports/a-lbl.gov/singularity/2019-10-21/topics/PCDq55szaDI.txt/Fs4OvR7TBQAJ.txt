Vanessa, David,

thank you very much for your messages and the warm welcome! :)

The workflow involving Singularity Hub is indeed very interesting! That way 
the cluster would be downloading the image from the Hub, which is probably 
much faster than our uplink.

I do have some questions in this regard:

1) I am not sure if the Hub builder will be able to reproduce all the build 
dependencies I have.
I was planning to involve some complicated processes to assemble the 
install scripts, push files from my laptop into the image, etc.
Not sure if this is a good idea in the long run, but I am just at the 
beginning... this is the way I setup my first image, at least.

2) If I understand correctly, "sregistry" is basically the software behind 
Singularity Hub, but deployable to our server... I find it very useful, 
thank you for that!
So, to mitigate (1) the idea would be to have this "private" registry 
configured to be able to perform our build, right? I am not sure where the 
cloud builders come in, though?

3) Is there actually any interest at all in the "composing" idea I outlined 
in the original message? If so, I could open an issue on github for 
tracking purposes.
I guess that overlayfs could be used to implement this, but I might be 
oversimplifying.
