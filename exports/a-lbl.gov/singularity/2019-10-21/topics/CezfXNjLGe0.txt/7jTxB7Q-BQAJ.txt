Thanks David and Tru!

I picked a few tidbits out of both your configs plus using xenial instead 
of trusty, and it works!!! Whoooo!! I couldn't seem to get either to work 
by themselves though as they use the old configuration and my version of 
singularity gets fussy with the old configuration. I have to use the new 
one.

Now I have to figure out how to clean it up....

I can *not* get it to keep my environmental settings. Even after editing 
/environment I have to still set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH.

Also, I am not sure how to best pass in a python script for it to execute. 
Ultimately the users are going to have to interact with it by SLURM 
submission and I would prefer it not be an interactive one.

But these are the things to figure out as I learn. :-P

Thanks!
