Subject: Re: [Singularity] Is there a way to target a specific version of
 singularity with remote build?

Oh, I work at The University of Chicago. I'm using a shared resource. The
admins have plans in motion to upgrade a lot of things at once, but their
timeline is several months and we want to start using singularity now.

I also saw that you are working on a deployable remote build server. Do you
think that would also support build targeting at the same time as the
remote build service?

Thanks!
