Hi,

  So, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations or best practices 
around the tagging/versioning of images uploaded to sregistry?  I've seen 
cases where a container will have both a "latest" and a <version> entry in 
the registry.  Is it simply one upload with a "--tag latest --tag 
<version>", or two separate uploads , one for latest and one for 
<version>?  Just trying to figure out the best way to do this and provide 
the correct documentation to our users/developers.

-Mike
