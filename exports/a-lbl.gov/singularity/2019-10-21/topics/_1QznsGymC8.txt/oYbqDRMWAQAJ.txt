Subject: Re: [Singularity] how to list/stop running singularity containers?
 like in docker "docker ps"

The instance.list command is the correct corresponding to docker ps, the
general mapping is "show me the instances of running containers." But I
think what you are asking about is more of a general list of container
processes, and we don't have a good command for that. The key difference is
that a uesr running a docker container is still running via docker (and the
pid is kept track of) but for singularity, the final execv is to the
run/shell so if you looked for a singularity process, you wouldn't find it.
If you tried something like:

pgrep -fa singularity

you could get generally processes with singularity in the name, but that's
not going to work for shell / run / anything because of what I just
described. For example I just tried this, and my shell inside the container
is just shown on my system as running bash. For this same reason you can't
peep into /usr/local/var/singularity/mnt.

If you look in the session directory (usually tmp) you can get a hint of
current (and sometimes non cleaned up) sessions:

 ls /tmp/.* | grep "singularity-runtime"

But that's not so useful.

So I'm not sure I can offer a good solution, maybe others can comment. We
don't have a central orchestration to keep track of all container
processes, beyond the ones that are more by definition running as
instances. When you have a bunch of container instances running, they each
have associated namespace / pid and then when you run as sudo you can do
things like list, stop all, etc. If you are interested in singularity being
run on a cluster resource, you could use lmod to keep track of loads, and
then look for singularity commands used in batch scripts. That could
minimally give you a way to identify running jobs (with singularity) on
your resource to stop, if needed.

Anyone have ideas for how/if we could implement an equivalent ps for a
superuser?
