Hi everyone, I am exploring Singularity for CI of some HPC codes.  Using 
our current recipe I noticed that in general it would seem very useful to 
have secrets like SSH keys etc at image build time that are strictly 
excluded in the finished shared image.  I realize there are often other 
ways to get authentications done at build time, but it would be most 
compelling if Singularity fit close with other flows that are using 
deploy-keys etc so I can manage them together.

Does singularity have such a feature (ways to handle secrets) already or 
plan to have an equivalent feature?  I confess I am just getting started 
with Singularity, and plead ignorance if I skimmed past it.

Thanks!
