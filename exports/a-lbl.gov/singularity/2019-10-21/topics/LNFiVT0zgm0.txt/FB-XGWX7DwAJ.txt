Thank you for your reply. In fact,for some reason, we cannot change the
kernel unless company=E2=80=99s leadership requires=EF=BC=8Cbut maybe I fou=
nd another way
to solve it, I found the requirement of this function is added after 2.5.0
version, so I try to install 2.4.6 and it worked.As for the upgrade, I will
tell leaders . Whatever, thank you for your reply and have a nice day!
