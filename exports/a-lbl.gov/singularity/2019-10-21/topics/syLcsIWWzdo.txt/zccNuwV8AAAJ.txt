The ability to submit jobs within a container is important for certain 
domain applications where future job submissions depend on the progress of 
the currently running job.  This capability is useful for adaptive 
parameter space sampling, for example, where you want to automatically 
launch addition jobs from within a running job so as to get coverage over a 
region that has insufficient sampling.  Typically, these additional jobs 
are launched not at the conclusion of the running job and not at uniform 
intervals but at arbitrary intervals determined adaptively based on some 
built-in logic.  Furthermore, the additional jobs that were launched within 
a container can themselves launch jobs, etc.  This cascade of job 
submissions automates a lot of the grunt work, so that a research can start 
the project, walk away for coffee or to another project, and come back 
later to do the analysis workup when the data becomes available.

Also, if you can tailor each job to be short (< 4 hours, for example), you 
can take advantage of an HPC center's backfill capability for cycles that 
would otherwise go wasted in the drain state while preparing for jobs with 
long wallclock requirements.
