Bennet, do you have a configuration option for `bind point =3D /home` or
something similar in your config? That might do it.

Additionally, I want to reiterate (like a broken record), while debugging,
hacking and playing is all fine to do interactively, that breaks the
prescriptive recipe model that really facilitates reproducibility and
"documentation" of building containers. Think of the bootstrap deffile as
the recipe akin and integratable with configuration management.

Ok, it's safe to come out, I'm off my soapbox. ;-)

Thanks!

Anyway, I hope it did not seem like I was criticizing your experiment.=C2=
