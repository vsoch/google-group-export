Hi,

I have noticed some inconsistencies in how the $HOME environment variable 
is set. I would expect that it would be set to the same folder as what 
passed through the --home option, but it remains identical as the host 
$HOME:

me@host> singularity --version
2.4.1-master.gf2d7795d
me@host> echo $HOME
/home/me
me@host> singularity shell -v -H /home/notme myImage 
[...]
VERBOSE: Skipping home dir mounting (per config)
[...]
me@singularity> pwd
/home/notme
me@singularity> echo $HOME
/home/me

The same thing happens if I run through sudo. There is one difference 
between sudo and non-sudo calls though:
- as a normal user, using the --cleanenv option fixes the problem
- as sudo user, --cleanenv does nothing, but "env -i singularity shell ..." 
works (but it creates other problems later, with apt in particular).

The fix is relatively easy, I can just set $HOME and run my .bashrc 
manually or through a script (/.singularity.d/actions/exec ?) once the 
container is running, but is that really how it is intended to work?

As a side note, I didn't find much documentation on the --home/-H option 
(nothing in http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-mount, where I would expect it 
to be). Perhaps I'm wrong, but I imagine that most users need it (having 
your host and container $HOME shared seems like a recipe for a disaster 
...), so having some official documentation would be great!


Regards,
Guillaume
