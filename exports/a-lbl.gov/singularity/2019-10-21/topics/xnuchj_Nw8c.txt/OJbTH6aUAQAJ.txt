Thanks Ryan!

I don't think this will be an issue with the current development branches
we are working on thanks to Brian's configuration file parser upgrades.
Soon I will be merging into the development branch and at which point I
will be asking for people to test. Would be great if you can try to
replicate this issue when we do that.

Thanks again!

Greg

&gt; &gt; Hi there,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I=E2=80=99ve upgraded Singularity recently from 2.0 to 2.2 and th=
en to 2.2.1. After the upgrade, it stopped working. On 2.2, I got:<br>

&gt; &gt; [novosirj@sirius /scratch/novosirj]$ gdc-client<br>
&gt; &gt; ERROR=C2=A0 : Failed to mount image in (read only): Invalid argum=
ent<br>
&gt; &gt; ABORT=C2=A0 : Retval =3D 255<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In this situation, gdc-client is a symlink to gdc-client.img. gdc=
-client.img is a Singularity image created on CentOS 7 with Singularity 2.0=
. This used to work fine. I don=E2=80=99t recall the exact means I used to =
make this automatically run the gdc-client when
 executing the container name, but I followed the directions at the time (i=
t does not look like I can get a shell into the container now to look).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I then upgraded to 2.2.1. Now I get no output at all. gdc-client =
--help used to show the help output. Now, nothing. The initial install and =
both upgrades were done by using rpmbuild -ta on the .tar.gz file. I should=
 mention that both times, the install
 created an .rpmnew config file. Was something necessary added in the later=
 versions? Is there any information on upgrading (couldn=E2=80=99t find it =
on the website)?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, any idea for where I should start looking? Thanks for you=
