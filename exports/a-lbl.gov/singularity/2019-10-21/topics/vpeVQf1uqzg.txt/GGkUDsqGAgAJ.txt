I agree with you Chris - Greg would you be open to this as well?

The docker2singularity.sh started as a small script and has turned into an
important thing, so my suggestion is that we make a singularity-docker
repo. This can house the main Dockerfile to be built on the hub, but also
have a single folder with the docker2singularity.sh script for those not
wanted the additional Docker layer.
