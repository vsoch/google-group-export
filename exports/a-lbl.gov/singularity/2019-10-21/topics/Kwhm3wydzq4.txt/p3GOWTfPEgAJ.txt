I am required to provide download counts of Singularity to the US Depart Of
Energy powers that be, but GitHub does not offer a suitable method to track
this (except for release attachments, which is not an accurate count).
Because of this, I created the Singularity system registry, where you can
self identify your usage. This is important as it helps to justify my time
developing the project.

I need to report to DOE today, so I ask if you have not already done so,
please fill out the registry form on the main landing page at:
http://singularity.lbl.gov

The direct link to the form:

Thank you!
