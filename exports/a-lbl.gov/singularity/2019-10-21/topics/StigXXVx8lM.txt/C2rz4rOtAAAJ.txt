Hi Robert,

Additionally to what Vanessa mentioned, you can't rename an .iso file to
.img and expect it to work. You have to create the image, bootstrap or
import into it, and then you can use it. Here is a more specific quick
start to your use case:

git clone -b development https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git
cd singularity
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
# now the latest development code is installed, so you can use it:
singularity create /tmp/ubuntu.img
singularity import /tmp/ubuntu.img docker://ubuntu:latest
singularity shell /tmp/ubuntu.img

Hope that helps!
