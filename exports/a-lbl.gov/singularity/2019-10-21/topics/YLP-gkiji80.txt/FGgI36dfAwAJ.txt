Hi Igor, et al.,

I just noticed that this crash is at the same point in fs/dcache.c:946 that 
was noted by DrDaveD in this GitHub issue, against Red Hat EL 7.2

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/228

Was noted in the issue that the panic did not happen on RHEL 7.3.

From the Red Hat release notes on overlayfs tech preview, and the issue 
above, it seems likely that overlayfs problems on RHEL 7.x might be most 
common when the underlying FS is not something standard. What is it in this 
case? In the issue, CVMFS was involved.

I've personally not seen a crash with images on various RHEL 7.x versions 
where XFS, Lustre, GPFS have been the underlying filesystems holding images.

DT
