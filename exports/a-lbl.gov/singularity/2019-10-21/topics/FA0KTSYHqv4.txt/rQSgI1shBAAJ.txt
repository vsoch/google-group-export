Definitely not if you're in shell-land.  Also very little of that
information is relevant to the conversion isn't it?

Yes, but for anything like that in the filesystem, /etc seems the
right place, like /etc/redhat-release.

The sort of things I was assuming would be architecture (which isn't
obvious, is it?), OS, information about its creation (including the
conversion in this case), some description of what it does (including
whether it's usefully runnable directly), requirements to run it
(e.g. which external MPI).  I hadn't thought much about it, though.
