Hi Dave

Thank you for explanation on SLURM sacct, it makes sense.

What do you mean by "a new PID namespace"?
To run an application in container I set alias via corresponding module
file, i.e.

module load R

where the R module has:
...
module load singularity
set-alias R "singularity exec /path/to/container/R-3.4.1 /opt/R/3.4.1/bin/R
$*"

User can use R as usual w/o need to change submit scripts.

Thank you.
