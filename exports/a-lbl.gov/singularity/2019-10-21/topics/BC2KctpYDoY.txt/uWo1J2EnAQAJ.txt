I built today RPM packages for Singularity 2.4 (singularity, runtime, 
debuginfo, devel) and studied what files and folders are in there. I used 
as PREFIX environment variable /usr/local/singularity-2.4. Eventually I am 
planning to make the software available without separate installations for 
many users who have access to a shared network file system, hence my prefix 
would change to something else, but optimally still contain the version 
number inside. In the RPM files I saw that there are also different folders 
beside the folder I defined as PREFIX. As long as a subfolder was still 
containing the version number, this may work fine. However, one of the RPM 
packages contained files that will end up in /var/singularity/... - and 
here is no version number in the folder name anymore. What effects will 
that have when I want to provide our users multiple versions of Singularity 
over time? Is that even possible? In my understanding this would really 
require that all installed files are somehow in a main subfolder that I 
define as PREFIX environment variable when building the RPM packages, and 
also that it can be identified well using a version number. Can this be 
done somehow?

Any real-life experiences or feedback from the gurus will be highly 
appreciated. Thanks!

-Manuel
