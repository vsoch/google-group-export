You can change the cache with the environment variable SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=
, and it's a good idea that we might have this in the config. Do you want t=
o open an issue?

The layers and images from Singularity hub that go into the cache are in fa=
ct reused if you bootstrap again and need a layer that was previously downl=
oaded. You still would extract into the new image, but not need to wait for=
 download.

Best,

Vanessa
