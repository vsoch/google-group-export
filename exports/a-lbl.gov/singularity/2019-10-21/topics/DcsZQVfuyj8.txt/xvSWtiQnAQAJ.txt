Hi San,

The first command you tried 'systemctl start httpd.service' is trying to 
run httpd under the control of systemd, which is the init system used to 
manage services on a full Linux install. In a container you (almost always) 
don't have this available, and will need to run httpd directly, calling the 
`httpd` binary itself or using some other kind of script or supervisor 
application.

When you tried to run `systemctl start httpd.service` outside of the 
container the `systemctl` command was trying to talk to systemd on your 
host. You didn't have permission to do this - only root can talk to systemd.
