Hi there,

This is just a quick question about overlay support (using --overlay), with 
Singularity 3.2 (or better).

I've experimented launching containers with several overlays, and it seems 
to work fine. I get a fusion of all the overlays together.

E.g. for two squashfs filesystems and one ext3 filesystem I can run 
something like:

singularity shell --overlay squash1.sq --overlay squash2.sq --overlay 
data.ext3 

My question is: the documentation doesn't say anything about using several 
such overlays, so am I okay in assuming this is expected to work and will 
continue to work in the future? Or am I just lucky? :-)

Thanks!

Pierre
