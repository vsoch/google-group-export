The only thing that I can think of that might be causing this is the
#!/bin/sh shebang in the runscript.  iirc, conda really wants bash to work
properly.  I'm pretty sure that in 2.5.2 you can select a custom shebang
for you runscript just by writing one in.  Have you tried using #!/bin/bash
as your shebang in your runscript?
