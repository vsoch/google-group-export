Hey All,

I'm one of the HPC Sysadmins for University of Kansas. We use Panasas for 
our cluster file storage, and I'm having a bit of an issue getting 
Singularity to play nice with some of our Panasas. As is standard with a 
lot of compute clusters, we give users a home, work, and scratch directory 
to play in. Home is accessible under /home/<username> as would be expected, 
and we do this with a symlink to the home volume under our Panasas mount. 
Like I said before we also give a work and scratch directory to every user 
and these directories have higher space limitations than the home directory 
so that's where most everyone puts their files. When I start a Singularity 
container, I don't have any issues with /home, that just seems to work. 
What doesn't seem to work is anything else that needs to reach out to the 
Panasas. Users all have a symlink in their homedir that points to their 
work and scratch and those links appear to be broken, and that Panasas 
doesn't show up at all, even though I've enabled what I think would be the 
relevant settings in my singularity.conf file (which I'll paste a condensed 
version of below in case you all see something I don't). Does anyone have 
any experience with using Panasas in this context with Singularity? So far 
the people I know that use both only use the homedir as the only link to 
the outside world so to speak, but that's not enough for our users. Also, 
just for a relevant info include, we run RHEL 6.4 with a 2.6 kernel.

Thanks!
