In general, once an application has been launched via a Singularity contain=
er the execution process is limited to that container. Even if you call a b=
inary or script outside the container in your home file system (which is on=
 the host) it will still be launched within the namespace of the contained =
parent process.=20

It sounds like you are wanting the call to a binary on the host to escape t=
he container's namespace. If so, I don't know a way around this but somethi=
ng I've heard about recently is the idea of function shipping which maybe h=
elpful. Unfortunately I know almost nothing about it aside from it sounds c=
ool.=20

Now for the loophole with scripts and interpreted files... In Singularity y=
our home directory (and/or current working directory) is shared into the co=
ntainer automatically so if you had additional files, modules, or data it c=
ould be read and interpreted by the contained process already running. This=
 might work with binaries but just remember they will be linked by the cont=
ainer's library stack not that of the host, so portability maybe an issue w=
ithout appropriate mitigations.=20

To me this sounds very much like the previous example.=20

You could in theory do this with a pipe? Maybe not as integrated as you wou=
ld prefer but that could do it.=20

$ singularity exec ~/Foooo.img script-name | program-on-host

If I understand this use-case, then yes. Both R and Eclipse exist in the sa=
me container image and would inter operate as they are designed to.=20

Hopefully that helps!
