Hi there.  Sounds like you are getting started with Singularity.  Awesome.

Yes, any libraries that your containers will need (like MKL) will need to
be installed into the container.  It's not necessary for them to have the
same path as the libs on the HPC system.

MPI is sort of a special case.  It's not necessary in all cases to match
the version of the MPI library to the version running on the HPC system,
but there are others in this group that can speak to the vagaries of MPI
with more authority.  These links might help you get a handle on what is
happening.

http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-hpc#integration-with-mpi

NVIDIA driver libraries are also a special case because they control things
in kernel space.  Kernel space isn't virtualized by the container.  But
with the current version of Singularity there is no need to install those
libs yourself.  You need only invoke the --nv flag.
