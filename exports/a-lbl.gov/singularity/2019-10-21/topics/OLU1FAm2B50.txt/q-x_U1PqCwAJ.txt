Hi everyone,

I am possibly an odd duck by having tcsh as my default shell on our HPC 
systems. In the containers I use bash, and don't even install tcsh. This 
worked fine in 2.2.1. I.e., start the container with -s or 
SINGULARITY_SHELL set, get the requested shell.

With 2.3, I am seeing this when shelling into the container:

$ singularity shell -s /bin/bash ubuntu_python.img
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

ERROR: Shell does not exist in container: /bin/tcsh
ERROR: Using /bin/sh instead...

It seems like Singularity 2.3 is trying to start tcsh for me, and backfalls 
to sh, despite explicitly asking for bash with the -s flag. I would expect 
that the requested shell would take precedence over what the user has as 
default.

Can someone please comment on this?

Thanks,
MC
