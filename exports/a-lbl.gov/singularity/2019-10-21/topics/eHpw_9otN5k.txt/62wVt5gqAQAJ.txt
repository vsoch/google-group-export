Hi Steve,

There is a known bug in 2.0 related to exactly what you are seeing. I
realize that 2.1 testing was just announced yesterday evening but I would
be grateful if you can test it. Plus that particular bug is fixed in it
(granted there are no doubt others we still have yet to find). Lol

Thanks, and keep us informed!
