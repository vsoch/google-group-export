What's the simplest method of running a command using sudo during %post? 

I'm trying to build an Arch Linux based recipe (using `Bootstrap: arch`) 
and want to install some packages provided by the AUR using the standard 
`makepkg` suite. However, `makepkg` must be run as a regular user (with 
sudo) as opposed to root (it will exit immediately if run as root). For our 
current Docker builds we create a user, give them sudo permissions, do the 
necessary installations using `makepkg`, and then delete the user. However, 
my first pass using this method during %post fails because all the 
available filesystems are mounted with `nosuid` (at least according to 
`mount` run during %post). Short of binding an external filesystem and 
using that as a suid environment, is there a way that I can make this work? 
I have tried remounting the root filesystem during %post but still get a 
`nosuid` error. Since there is already an Arch recipe on Github I am 
imagining that someone has encountered this before and has a method of 
getting `makepkg` working in a recipe.  

Thanks in advance!
