My workaround is to write a wrapper script that creates an empty directory 
then invokes singularity, mapping that temporary directory to home via the 
-H option.  I just thought it might be nice if singularity provided an 
option not to map a user's home directory, specifically to avoid 
unexpected, site-specific external dependencies.

Thanks,

Chris
