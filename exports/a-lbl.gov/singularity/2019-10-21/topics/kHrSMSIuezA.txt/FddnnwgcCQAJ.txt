Hi Claudiu,

There is no procedure for connecting Singularity containers, as Singularity 
is using the host networking stack, so any service you run (like mongodb) 
is directly available at the host, and should be available to other 
containers.

The ping error you get is expected as ping requires elevated privileges you 
won't have when you are in a Singularity container as a user.

Since you are able to connect at mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 it's likely 
something is going on in the daemon container such that it is not making 
the connection properly. Can you give more information about what this 
container is, and/or how it is trying to make a mongodb connection?

Cheers,

DT
