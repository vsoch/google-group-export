Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity - Accessing files created through

I'm no expert and there may be a better way...
I use copy statements in the %setup section of my Singularity.def

cp myfile ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/opt/libs/myfile

I then explicitly export libraries in the %runscript section
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/libs

I think there should be a better way to deal with the second step using the
environment file, but I didn't get that to work yet.
