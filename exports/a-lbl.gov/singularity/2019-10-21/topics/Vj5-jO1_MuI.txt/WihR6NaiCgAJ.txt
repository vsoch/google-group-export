Subject: Re: [Singularity] singularity hub?

Very nice and most valuable work!

A few comments:

Would it make sense to add a "top" repository to
https://github.com/singularityhub where issues related specifically to
the Singularity Hub can be discussed?  And it would provide a natural
way to "Star" it on GitHub as well ;)

I think there could be a need for _not_ building all GitHub branches.
For instance, some branches may be pure development branches.  These a
typically being used with lots of commits / pushes.  I'm a big fan of
the "git flow" model (https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)
where this is the case, i.e. you have a `master` and a `develop`
branch and then at times various `feature/*` and `hotfix/*` branches,
cf. https://singularity-hub.org/collections/44/.  Maybe this could be
achieved by controlling this via some .singularityhub.yml file (don't
think the Singularity file is the place for this):

## Exclude these branches
branch:
  - exclude:
    - develop
    - feature/.*

and / or

## Only include these branches
branch:
  - include: master

As a complement (or an alternative?) to build based on Git branches
(`git branch`), I'd like to propose building on Git tags (`git tag`).
That would also give a natural way of providing multiple versions
without cluttering up the repos with multiple branches.  The default
(no tag) could still be to build what's on the master branch.  From
the user's perspective this could look like:

singularity pull shub://myrepo/image (master branch)
singularity pull shub://myrepo/image@1.2
singularity pull shub://myrepo/image@1.9

The Username/Repository@tag format follows the GitHub Autolink
standard (https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/).
(This is also widely used in the R community, e.g.
install_github("Username/Repository@tag").

Thanks

Henrik
