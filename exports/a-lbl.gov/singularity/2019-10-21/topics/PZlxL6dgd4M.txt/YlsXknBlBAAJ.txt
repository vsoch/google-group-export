Thanks Bernard!!!

I will do an install of OpenSuSE and test it out shortly! Hopefully next
week (when 2.1 should be released), we can update this in the distros!

Hrmm, not sure about what project to put it in as I am not very familiar
with OpenSuSE builds. Anyone else with experience in this who can weigh in
their thoughts?
