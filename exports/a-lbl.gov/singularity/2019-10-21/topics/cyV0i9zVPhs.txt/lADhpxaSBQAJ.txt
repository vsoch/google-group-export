Subject: Re: [Singularity] Feature request: Would like to be able to define

I see.  I think this is far from selfish.  Altruistic in fact.

So what you want is to be able to define bind points within the container
itself so that it automatically binds itself to the appropriate
directories?  I actually asked for the very same feature a long time ago.
(Maybe a year?)  If I remember correctly at that time Greg said he didn't
want to support that because it goes against one of the main goals if
Singularity: portability.  We should ask again and see what he thinks.  Are
you on Slack?  What's your handle?  Or if you want to raise an issue on
GitHub we can chat about it there as well.
