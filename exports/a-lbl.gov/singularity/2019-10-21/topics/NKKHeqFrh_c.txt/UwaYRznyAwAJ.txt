Hey Trey,

I'll give you my $0.02.  I think that allowing image building on a
production system is not really in line with the Singularity philosophy.
(Though I defer to Greg who originally wrote Singularity to spell out what
the philosophy actually ought to be.)  But imho you should have a
"production system" where you run your containers and a "build system"
where you create your containers.  Ideally the "build system" should be a
system that you fully control.  A VM, or AWS instance or something would
work well for this.  Then after the image is built you can copy it to you
"production system".

Would this model work in your environment, or is there something preventing
it (like an air-gapped secure system)?

Dave
