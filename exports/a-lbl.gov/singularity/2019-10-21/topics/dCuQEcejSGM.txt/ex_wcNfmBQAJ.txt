Stefan is right about the reliability factors and conditional dependencies.
In Singularity v1, this was one of the major issues and causes for changing
quickly to 2.x.

Iff, the workflow you want to contain is *exactly* the same as what you are
packaging, conditional dependencies won't be much of a problem. But if you
want to work on external data (e.g. on your host system) that could
possibly change how the internal program works or takes a different
workflow/pathway, it is very difficult to do reliably.

When I've thought about how to do this, it always ends up relying on the
system's packaging DB. For example, if a ptrace()'ed dependency like
`/usr/bin/python` is found, query the RPM or DEB database, and include
every file that is part of that package, and then check to see what other
dependencies for that package exist, and grab all of those files too, and
loop recursively.

Anyway, just thinking outloud.
