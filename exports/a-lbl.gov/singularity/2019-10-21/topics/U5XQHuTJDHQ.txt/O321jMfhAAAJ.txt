Hey, I have a question about the user privileges in singularity containers. 
My use-case is to use singularity basically as VMs and I would like for 
each user to have complete control over his VM instances. When someone 
builds a Ubuntu container I would like for him to have sudo privileges 
within this container. E.g. when the user runs his container, he can use *apt 
install* or *apt remove. *The only way I can use these is to run the 
respective singularity command with *sudo*, but I do not want to give them 
sudo permissions. I was thinking about giving them sudo permissions only on 
singularity commands, but I am not sure how safe it is and they would also 
gain access to the containers of other people.

Is there any other way to have sudo capabilities for users within their 
containers?
