Hi Felix,

Maybe you can try to outsourc your script into a run.sh and write the 
absolute path in %runscript.

Like this:

%runscript
/home/"username"/run.sh

dont Forget to give execute Rights.

you can also run singularity shell arcsi-base.img to test the diffrent 
Options.

I hope this is not stupid :)

Greeting Tobi
