Hi,

In my project I wanted to use lightweight linux distro with java as a base. 
I have used Arch and after all I have created `Singularity` file.
In the next step I just wanted to reuse that base image (? definition). In 
docker there is FROM keyword. How can I do the same trick in singularity?

How following Singularity example should looks like? Is there any option I 
can do 'inherit' a file?  `Bootstrap: local   From: ../base/Singularity`

Bootstrap: singularity
from: ??????

%post

     # Install dedicated software


Thanks a lot,
Jack
