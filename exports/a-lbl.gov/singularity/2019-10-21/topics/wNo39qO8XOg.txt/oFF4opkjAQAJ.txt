Ok, here's a weird one for you all.  Let's say I want a SINGLE singularity 
image available that contains my entire workflow, but within that image I 
need to be able to call other singularity images (e.g. say my primary 
workflow needs Ubuntu xenial, but I need to be able to call an image that 
requires bionic).  I can write an "outer" wrapper, of course, to tie images 
together, but is there some way that I can embed a nested singularity image 
inside some "master" image?  If so, can someone point me at a definition 
file that shows this example?
