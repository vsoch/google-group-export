Subject: Re: [Singularity] (new user) Layers of containers and do I need an OS
 in my container?

In general, containers should be as lightweight as possible to achieve the
task desired. The container can be viewed as a set of tagged processes that
are isolated from others by various mechanisms and not as a form of a fully
virtualized machine. It shares functionality with the kernel of its host,
and so for efficiency you can install only those components you need to
accomplish the purpose of the containerized application. Useful containers
can be built that occupy only a few to a few tens of megabytes. Installing
a full OS within the container is often not necessary; though stripped-down
versions of some OS=E2=80=99s are available that are specifically built for=
 uses
such as in containers.

It is also possible to have a workflow that builds applications in
containers and then prepares smaller containers with only the contents
needed to run the application rather than all of the build tools that are
no longer needed at runtime.

In general you can and from some points of view really should regard the
container for your purpose as immutable once built, and only meant for
deployment, and concentrate on developing a workflow that creates them
reproducibly and in as lightweight a form as reasonably possible for the
purpose at hand.
