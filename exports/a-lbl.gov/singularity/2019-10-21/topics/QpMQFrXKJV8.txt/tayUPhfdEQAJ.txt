Happy New Year everyone,

  I am using underlay mounts to work-around the lack of overlay mount on 
CentOS 6 bare metal images on our systems while we migrate to CentOS 7 and 
migrate workloads into containers.  I occasionally see the following type 
of message, especially with NVIDIA GPU support:

WARNING: Underlay of /etc/openldap required more than 50 (91) bind mounts
WARNING: Underlay of /usr/bin/nvidia-cuda-mps-server required more than 50 
(1998) bind mounts

Does anyone have any idea about the severity of these warnings?  Are there 
any parameters that can be set to address them?  This is all a short-term 
workaround while we get to containers/sregistry/CentOS 7 bare metal.

Thanks

-Mike
