Hi Oliver,

I think you are making some assumptions and running down some rabbit holes
here.

> That's true, but you have people experienced with distro packaging, I
believe. So it might be good to include them in such decisions.

Greg and jms are probably the two people most experienced with packaging at
Sylabs and they were both tightly included in this decision.

> So in other words, you say if I build on a modern kernel (i.e. "passing
the build time check") and then run on a system with an older kernel,
checks may be nought?

Don't really know where you are getting that.  We have both build and
runtime checks which are independent of one other.  I encourage you to read
the code and raise issues/PRs if you see anything that might cause a
problem.

As for the decision to install via rpm/deb or from source, the NO_NEW_PRIVS
check is not preventing a user from building and installing a package via
the supplied spec files.  And it will be just as difficult to install on an
outdated kernel if one is doing so from source because the checks occur at
the configure stage.  So I think that discussion is not relevant to this
issue.

Dave

&gt;&gt; Running Singularity in any way shape or form on systems without=C2=
=A0NO_NEW_PRIVS=C2=A0is not supported.=C2=A0 Nobody is going to be testing =
older versions of the kernel for undiscovered vulnerabilities that might st=

&gt; <br>
</span>&gt; In other words we cannot ensure that the runtime checks are the=
 relevant checks in this case.=C2=A0 The runtime checks (which do also exis=
t btw) are only in response to the vulnerabilities we have already discover=
ed.=C2=A0 Kernels without PR_NO_NEW_PRIVSare inherently insecure for many o=
f the operations carried out by Singularity and those kernels are just not =
supported.=C2=A0 <br>
<br>
So in other words, you say if I build on a modern kernel (i.e. &quot;passin=
g the build time check&quot;) and then run on a system with an older kernel=
, checks may be nought? <br>
So what&#39;s the build time check good for? Only those few others compilin=
g on the same system they are executing on? <br>
<br>
If building on a system which is more modern than the execute node is unsaf=
e, this should certainly be documented! <br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it is fair for you to attribute malicious intent to =
what you view as an incorrect packaging decision.=C2=A0 But it is true that=
 Sylabs doesn&#39;t have any distro maintainers on staff.=C2=A0 <br>
<br>
</span>That&#39;s true, but you have people experienced with distro packagi=
ng, I believe. So it might be good to include them in such decisions. <br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; The way I see it, we are really supplying the files for rpm and deb pa=
ckaging as a courtesy. You can look at them as a template for how you might=
 write your own (if you really don&#39;t want to install from source for so=
me reason), <br>
<br>
</span>Well, my reason is the one pointed out by your CEO in his mail from =
04.04.2018 00:02, let&#39;s quote:<br>
&quot;My own personal note/comment.... Singularity is a system package, and=
 should be installed into the operating system, not on a shared file system=
 with modules. This is because typically that usage model is really good fo=
r when you have lots of different versions of applications installed and th=
e user can pick which one they want. In general, you don&#39;t want to do t=
his with any SETUID enabled codebase. RPM/DEB packages are your friend here=
, [...]&quot;<br>
<br>
I&#39;m sorry, but I agree with him on this, for the SETUID enabled codebas=
e at least (which is exactly what he says). <br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; but they shouldn&#39;t be used as is by distro maintainers.=C2=A0 We&#=
39;ve actually had some discussions about stripping those files down, makin=
g them very basic, and explicitly stating that they are templates provided =
as a courtesy and we are not accepting PRs on them.=C2=A0 You&#39;ve &gt; n=
o-doubt noticed that we don&#39;t have a lot of resources for reviewing and=
 merging packaging-related PRs.=C2=A0 It&#39;s not that we are uninterested=
 in this, it just doesn&#39;t happen to be our main expertise and focus.=C2=
=A0 And I think that is OK. <br>
<br>
</span>Let&#39;s continue the quote:<br>
&quot;[...] and if you need/want access to prebuilt, tested, and signed ver=
sions available via YUM, go here: <a href=3D"http://www.sylabs.io/singulari=
ty" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http://www.sylabs.io/<wbr>singular=
ity</a>&quot;<br>
<br>
How will Sylabs provide these if packaging for distros is not your expertis=
e? <br>
<br>
But I agree, the packaging files in the Singularity repo are only out of co=
urtesy, and that&#39;s fine. <br>
Still, it&#39;s not nice that packaging is made harder by introducing a bui=
ld-time check which only helps the few people running in the very same envi=
ronment in which they build (which usually only developers do...). <br>
It also means, taking your statement literally, that people with a more up-=
to-date build node than their execute nodes may be granted a false sense of=
 security. <br>
<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Hi Oliver,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Please see my explanation to Lars above on why=
 these checks matter at build time. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0which ones?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The explanation I read only explained that you want=
 to enforce people building singularity on older environments have to patch=
 out the misplaced checks themselves.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0There was no explanation at all why the checks are =
done at build time instead of at the correct place, i.e. at post-install of=
 the deb / rpm packages or at runtime.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0It seems there are common misconceptions about how =
packaging on Linux in general works amongst the Singularity devs.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I hope that&#39;s discussed at some point in Sylabs=
, including @gmk, who (as one of the experienced persons from CentOS) shoul=
d be able to point out to the others why build-time checks for run-time fun=
ctionality<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0are *not* done for any Linux package, and if they a=
re for the rare exceptions where upstream devs do not understand the implic=
ations,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0are generally patched out at distro level.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If Singularity want&#39;s to make packaging harder =
by violating established best practices, that&#39;s a statement on its own.=
 Maybe the goal is not anymore to see widespread adoptiona and enter Debian=
 / RedHat main repositories,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0but to rather sell off Singularity Pro packages?<br=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Lars is completely right.<b=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Checking for something at b=
uild time which matters at runtime is clearly a bug.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If you look around at Linux=
 distros people are using, 99 % of the packages used in the world have *not=
* been compiled on the machine they are running on.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Hence, it&#39;s just the wr=
ong approach checking in the build environment for something you want to en=
sure at runtime.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; <br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0For example, we build our R=
PMs and DEBs on the OpenBuildService. There&#39;s no reason the kernels the=
re should match the kernels on the machines we deploy those DEBs / RPMs to.=
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If the official statement f=
rom Sylabs is, that nobody cares for packaging in RPMs and DEBs, that&#39;s=
 of course a statement. Apparently, this is the case, since this kind of is=
sues are repeated again and again.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0It seems there are fundamen=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0That&#39;s completely unrel=
ated to the fact that of course everybody should update their build machine=
s to modern kernels. I fully agree with that. But please don&#39;t implemen=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0There is a correct place, a=

 is going to be testing older versions of the kernel for undiscovered vulne=
