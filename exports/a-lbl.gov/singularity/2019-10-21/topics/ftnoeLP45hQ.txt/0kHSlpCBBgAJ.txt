Hi Stefan,

No apologies necessary. I think you are correct, we need better
documentation on both fronts (making changes to the singularity.conf and
the dependencies of the host and containers). I am hoping the first will be
available soon with the new site and documentation effort, and the latter
will be contributed by people who wish to post recipes for particular
things.

Thank you for the feedback and the results of your testing!

Greg

We have just started to play with singularity and think about using it on o=
ur HPC systems - thanks for a great new tool!<br>
<br>
Our HPC clusters are connected via infiniband to a parallel file system (Be=
eGFS, formerly known as FhGFS) which we want to use inside a singularity co=
ntainer.<br>
<br>
On the host, this is mounted as /beegfs and I have provided the same mount =
point inside the container. Also the container has a /etc/singularity/singu=
larity.c<wbr>onf file with a &quot;bind path =3D /beegfs=E2=80=9D line (is =
that being used?) - anything else we need to do?<br>
<br>
Many thanks in advance!<br>
