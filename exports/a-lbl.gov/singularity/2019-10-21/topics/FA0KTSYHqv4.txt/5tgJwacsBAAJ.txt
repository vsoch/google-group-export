Subject: Re: [Singularity] docker conversion

What I'd like to see is a collaboration working on the implementation
details and then integrate those findings (citing the sources) into the
existing Singularity command architecture (either directly into import or a
new docker-import command). I would prefer to keep all Singularity
functions within the shell based command syntax.

A point that Dave brought up which is worth reiterating is regarding
licensing and copyright assertion. I won't accept a non-BSD license. MIT
license may be acceptable if BSD is impossible for you, but no GPL, Apache
or other OSI approved licenses will be accepted. Additionally, I leave
copyright assertion up to the contributor. When you send a patch or pull
request it is your choice to also include your copyright information (or
not). I will not limit acceptance of a patch based on copyright.

I will add that information to the website and documentation as soon as I
can.
