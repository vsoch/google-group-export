Hi Martin,

Singularity Hub gets access to all repos, not just one repo or
organization. It gets access to those repos via your user account.
Organizations have an extra layer of permissions so by default third party
apps can't access when a user authenticates with them, which is why it
worked only when you turned off the restrictions.  If someone else from
your organization wanted to access the repos, they would need to go through
the same authentication procedure. On the back end, each of you are
generated an Oauth2 credential and refresh token, independently from one
another.

If you could better clarify what you are asking, I can maybe help more -
I'm not totally sure what you are asking. I will reiterate the workflow in
case it helps. You have permission to read/write repos, some of them are
under your name, and some of them are in organizations. When you give SH
permission to access your repos, you are granting first the ones that you
have exclusive read/write, the ones under your name. But organizations have
many users, sometimes with different permissions, and so by default the
organization needs another layer of permission lifted for a third party app
to see the repos. For example, if there were a grad student in your
organization, he/she may only have read access, and you wouldn't want him
or her to give any kind of privilege to a third party app. You granted that
permission and thus could see them in SH.

Your docs look great so far! If you want a sneak peak at 2.3, check out the 2.3
branch
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/tree/docs/2.3>.
That's funny, I was just running around Utah last week :)

Best,

Vanessa
