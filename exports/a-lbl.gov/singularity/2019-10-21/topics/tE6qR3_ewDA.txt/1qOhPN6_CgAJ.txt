Hi Gregory,

Thank you very much for the update! I have re-built Singularity from the ne=
w sources here.

I went for older version of MOPAC, 6, for which sources are available, and =
looked into how it opens files. It does plain OPEN:

OPEN(UNIT=3D5,FILE=3DGETNAM('FOR005'),STATUS=3D'NEW')

The GETNAM routine is just a wrapper over getenv() , all it does

CALL GETENV(NAMEIN, NAMEOUT)
IF (NAMEOUT.EQ.'  ') NAMEOUT=3DNAMEIN

In my environment I have 'export FOR005=3Dtest.dat' ;  the error I get runn=
ing mopac6.sapp is the same,

forrtl: No such file or directory
forrtl: severe (29): file not found, unit 2, file /global/scratch/myuser/si=
ng-test/mopac/test.dat

So it looks like Fortran runtime somehow resolves the full path, if given o=
nly the filename?

Hi Grigory,

I wanted to circle back with you on this, and see if you made any progress.=
 I have added a bunch of features that will help you in debugging:

$ singularity strace [container name] (arguments)
$ singularity shell [container name]

Also, you can increasing the default debugging tools included within the co=
ntainer by adding this to your specfile (and rebuilding/reinstalling the ne=
w SAPP):

DebugOS: [0-3] (default is 1, and most debugging tools at present if 3)

Another thing I thought of would be if MOPAC could take the file from STDIN=
 rather then from a path to a file. If you can't get the file path to work =
properly (because MOPAC seems to rewrite the path to the file starting with=
 '/'), you might be able to use methods to pipe the data in.

Lastly, I have also added a basic test script that I will run before commit=
ting to make sure that what I break with every fix! LOL

Hope that helps, and let me know!

Greg

Hi Grigory,

There maybe other things going on as well but try to run it without the ref=
erence to 'pwd'.

This is because pwd always provides a fully qualified path (e.g. It starts =
with /). Paths that start with / will always resolve to inside the containe=
r (unavoidable without doing some serious trickery).

Let me know what happens from there.

MOPAC is a Fortran code and it would create test.out, test.arc and a few fo=
rt.XX files in the same directory. I suspect that it has to do with contain=
erization of paths which I admit I do not fully understand. How do I specif=

$ ./mopac.sapp `pwd`/test.mop<br>
forrtl: No such file or directory<br>

test/test.out<br>

MOPAC is a Fortran code and it would create test.out, test.arc and a few fo=
rt.XX files in the same directory. I suspect that it has to do with contain=
erization of paths which I admit I do not fully understand. How do I specif=
y path to the input file to make
 it work? Or, is there a trick in .sspec?<br>
