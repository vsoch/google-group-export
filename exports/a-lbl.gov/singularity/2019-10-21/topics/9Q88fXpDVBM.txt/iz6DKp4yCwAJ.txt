Sorry, for the wrong handling.

So, you already have CRIU directly on docker, LXC  or even OpenVZ :
 - https://criu.org/Docker
 - https://criu.org/LXC
 - https://criu.org/OpenVZ

Is there any plan to include CRIU in the next versions of singularity ?

There are many advantages to use freezing/restoring techs for a container.
For example, in a HPC environment, you can think to migrate a running job
from a host to another if anything went wrong or if you need more resources=
.

Best regards
