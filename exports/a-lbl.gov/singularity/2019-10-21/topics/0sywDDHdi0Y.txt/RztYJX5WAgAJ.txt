Hi Greg,

it could be that the CentOS dapl and ibverbs packages would be sufficient,
I copied them from the OFED distribution.

I still think it would be nice if there was a standard way of discovering
and adding dependencies (as in v1), perhaps with some additional twist to
automatically add things like IB drivers..?

Balazs
