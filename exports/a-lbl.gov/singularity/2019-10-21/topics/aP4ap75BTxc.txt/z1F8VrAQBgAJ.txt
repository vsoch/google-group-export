*Shortly after the release of Singularity 2.4.3 a community member
discovered that a newly-added dependency increases the Singularity attack
surface by unnecessarily linking the action-suid binary to libarchive, when
compiled on specific Linux distributions.  The only clean and fast way to
correct this problem is to remove the new docker-extract functionality,
which implements improved whiteout handling for docker containers. As a
temporary fix, several git commits will be reverted, and a new 2.4.4
release will be created.  This release will still include the remaining bug
and security fixes from the 2.4.3 release. The docker-extract functionality
will be re-implemented in a new version (tentatively 2.5) in a manner that
will avoid the issue. We sincerely apologize for the confusion and
inconvenience.  Thank you for your patience.The Sylabs team*
