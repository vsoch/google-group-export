Hi Reid,

I had a talk with my legal council, and he mentioned that I was wrong. The
wording is indeed part of the license, and now, as I understand, this
wording is necessary for us allow contributions and ensure that no
contributions limit our ability to use, update, or redistribute Singularity=
.

An example someone contributes code that they don't own (either via their
employer or outright stolen). If that code gets noticed by the rightful
owner, and we (LBNL) get challenged, we would have no recourse for
protecting ourselves. This license does that. It also gives the contributor
the freedom to assert a different license. So, if you are concerned, just
contribute your work specifically under the standard non-modified BSD 3
Clause license.

In the end, we want to distribute Singularity as openly and freely as
possible. This license is both open, and gives LBNL/DOE/UC legals the
foundation they need to stand on to be protected from a perceived risk
(e.g. tainted contribution).

Hopefully this addresses your concern, but if it does not I am probably not
the best person to explain this. I am happy to put you or LANL legals in
touch with LBNL legals.

Thanks,
Greg
