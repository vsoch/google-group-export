I haven't been paying attention here, but came to post after raising an
issue concerning legalese on contributing
<https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity/issues/117> which potential
contributors might note (and perhaps give a counterargument).  Anyhow I
can't contribute further in view of the LBL policy about contributing on
web site.

In the mean time, I see there's been discussion here about the licence.
Here are comments on things in that thread but I haven't assembled
quotations.

The Singularity licence has been evaluated as a free software one (and
_not_ standard 3-clause BSD) at least by Fedora legal (see references in
the issue).  That presumably means it conforms to the Open Source
Definition if you specifically care about "open source" in some form.
[Quoting Raymond won't persuade some of us of anything...]  The freeness
or compatibility of the licence specifically isn't an issue.

However, I think the default licensing clause is a potential booby trap,
as mentioned in the issue.  It looks to me as if the all-permissive
terms would allow copyright notices to be removed, for instance.  That
might come as a surprise and might not be allowed by an employer with a
copyright interest.  I'm intending to modify the Fedora packaging to
account for it.

It shouldn't matter whether or not anyone has raised issues about
copyright/licensing previously any more than with longstanding software
or documentation bugs.  It's suggestive that Greg was confused after
using the licence before, and I'd missed the extra clause initially,
thinking it was just BSD3 plus DoE disclaimer boilerplate.

I obviously can't say anything about LBL policy, but I wonder why it's
different from the other Labs'.  For what it's worth, for a few things I
have installed or know about from LBL I can see examples of different
licences:  Warewulf/NHC and voro++ have the Singularity's but apparently
without the separate language on contributing; IPM and SuperLU are
straight BSD3; blcr is LGPL2+; GASNet has a permissive licence that
licencecheck doesn't identify.

While it's not relevant to contributors, as a layman I don't understand
how the default contribution clause protects LBL.  I don't see how a
licence can assert the copyright status of anyone else's work and a
right to contribute it.  It seems actually to make it more likely
someone will contribute under terms they don't understand and have the
right to (e.g. if an employer holds copyright and wouldn't allow removal
of notices).

I am not a lawyer, corrections always welcome, etc.
