Note: I just noticed that the build instructions are completely wrong
in the admin-guide... :/   The *Note* there is relevant though.

So, we'll go with the instructions here until we get that fixed...

    https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html#compile-th=
e-singularity-binary

Seems we completely overlook the source build in the admin-guide ...  ...
