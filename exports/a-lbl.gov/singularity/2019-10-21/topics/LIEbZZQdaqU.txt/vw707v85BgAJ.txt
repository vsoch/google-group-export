Thanks Greg - non-zero return value - I could have thought of that when the 
grep returns nothing. A bash one-liner that does this is here:
if [ $(env|grep proxy>&/dev/null)$? = 0 ]; then env|grep proxy; fi
BUT, in sh (dash in Ubuntu), this still returns error code 1 if the grep 
search returns empty - while in bash it returns 0. 
Ugh. Were there some talk in using bash instead of sh in the bootstrap or 
am I too much off? dash shell documentation seems to be pretty sparse. I 
guess this is a stack overflow question, I am running out of ideas ;-)

Now, WRT "pip", the error is a bit long but the last piece is:
  File 
"/usr/share/python-wheels/urllib3-1.15.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl/urllib3/util/retry.py", 
line 236, in increment
    total -= 1
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'Retry' and 'int'

Essentially the same full errror is at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37495375/python-pip-install-throws-typeerror-unsupported-operand-types-for-retry

Here they are talking about the network proxy being the cause, though, I am 
not seeing any proxy in the boostrap (via that env|grep). 

The strange thing is that I get the error in the bootstrap using 
Singularity devel version, but, I don't get it using the stable 2.2.1 
version. So, I suspect something with the devel version that's different 
from the stable one that's triggering it.

In the singularity shell, I do it via the "sudo singularity shell -w", i.e. 
as a root, which I'd imagine would be similar to how it'd be run during the 
bootstrap?
