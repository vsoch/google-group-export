Subject: Re: [Singularity] Can Singularity hub build a writable image ?

Hi Samy,

Singularity Hub will not build a writable image, it will build you
squashfs. What you can do is build directly from a singularity hub uri into
a writable image:

   sudo singularity build --writable newImage.simg shub://vsoch/hello-world

That will save you one step of needing to pull first as the pull is done at
the same time as the build. The issue with the time is just a warning, but
you should post an issue on the Singularity issue board if you think there
is something fishy going on! From the look of it, you are probably trying
to shell into the container that has a home defined in /nfs, and your
cluster probably has overlayfs disabled so it cannot make this path on the
fly. Try setting --home to be something else (that *does* exist on your
cluster or where you are running it) to see if it goes away. I would also
suggest doing sudo with --writable, I don't see how you can interact with
an image with --writable without it (unless you are user root).

Best,

Vanessa
