Subject: Re: [Singularity] Bootstrap InstallPkgs config (rhel)
To: singularity@lbl.gov

I would vote yes as well. I mean, you're doing things in a specific
order. Installing 'epel-release', updating, and then installing
'.....', so... you're saying you want to change the repo list, update,
and then install other packages. Isn't changing it what you would
expect from that?

> That means that the bootstrap may have a different source/mirror URL then the installed OS

By "installed OS," do you mean the Singularity image OS? Or the host
OS? I mean, if it's the host OS, then yeah ... they could have
different source/mirror URL's. In fact I'd bet on it for a lot of
cases (like what I'm messing with). I don't want it to try using my
host config for what goes into the image.

If you believe that wrapping it in an if like:

CONF=""
if [ -f $SINGULARITY_BUILD_ROOT/$YUM_CONF ]; then
    CONF="-c $SINGULARITY_BUILD_ROOT/$YUM_CONF";
fi
$INSTALL_CMD --noplugins --nogpgcheck $CONF --installroot
$SINGULARITY_BUILD_ROOT -y install $*

By all means do that... I just know adding in the config option in the
InstallPkgs function, stops yum on SL7 from using the host yum repos
when installing into a singularity image of SL6.
