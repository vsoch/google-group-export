Hi Mike,

There is a bug in the caching of pulls from SHub / registry. Caching is not=
 working due to a mismatch in file extension when checking for the cached f=
ile. I=E2=80=99m afraid with the focus on 3.0 (where the caching has been c=
ompletely rewritten in Go) this is unlikely to be fixed in 2.x

This actually just came up in the slack channel also - apologies there is n=
o fix at present.

DT
