Hi David,

I'm not referring the automatic mount of host file paths, but to the
automatically import of the host environment variables in the container.

However checking the latest version in the development branch it turns out
that it include a new `--cleanenv ` option that's exactly what I was
mentioning.

Great work Singularity team =F0=9F=91=8F=F0=9F=91=8F

Cheers,
Paolo

I have been testing singularity to use it in our cluster. I was surprised t=
o see that the software that is installed in the computer where singularity=

 an R script that calls a java jar and I&#39;m calling it from singularity.=
 I do not have java installed in my container but it is still working becau=

<br>
Is this behavior normal in containers? How to make sure that is using, for =
