I don't have a good answer for this, but I'll give some things that might
help. First, you *could* look at your Singularity config directly, but
actually it's owned by whomever installed it (your cluster admin) so the
surest thing to do would be to ask him or her. I found these original
documentation
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt with a
git repo at the bottom that can be used to test (although likely requires
extra priviledges) and then finally, at least on our cluster where I know
we have it, there is an overlay parameters folder:

$ ls /sys/module/overlay/parameters/
> check_copy_up  index  redirect_always_follow  redirect_dir  redirect_max


and that is mentioned in the link above. Other than that, you could
try  cat /proc/filesystems | grep overlay. Maybe someone else on the list
has some ideas? But honestly, I'd just ask the people that manage the
cluster and have installed singularity - they will know! If I remember
correctly, for older versions of RHEL and/or Centos (maybe 5/6) it wasn't
supported, so you could check that too.
