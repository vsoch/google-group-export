That's what I thought, too.

Indeed that's what happens with Xfce in my case too.  In KDE, Plasma is
crashing, so start menu and panels are missing from the taskbar.
Something alike happens with Gnome too.  In each case, environment is
useful, in the sense that one can use right-click menu to reach "run
command" dialog, then start terminal, and run applications from there.
However, there are further issues with some applications, for example
while Firefox works fine, Emacs is crashing.


As far as using VNC server concerned, I'd prefer to avoid this.  The
idea would be everything to be transparent for the end-user, that should
just login under given username, and end up in an container environment
that looks completely the same like under native Linux distribution.
Mounting $HOME and /tmp is perfectly fine in my case too.  I have
experience with Singluarity only, and strictly in the domain of HPC, so
- could anyone advise is something alike maybe easier to accomplish with
Docker?
