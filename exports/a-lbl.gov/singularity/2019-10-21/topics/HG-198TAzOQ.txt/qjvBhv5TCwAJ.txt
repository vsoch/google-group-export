I have installed Singularity 2.4 on our Linux cluster which is running 
CentOS 7.4.  We prefer to have our software available as environment 
modules, and we use Lmod and EasyBuild for this purpose.
Unfortunately, I get a failure running the test example when Singularity 
has been installed as a module on a central NFS server.

$ cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708 (Core)
$ module load Singularity
$ which singularity
/home/modules/software/Singularity/2.4-GCC-6.3.0-2.27/bin/singularity
$ singularity run docker://godlovedc/lolcow

> Docker image path: index.docker.io/godlovedc/lolcow:latest
> Cache folder set to /home/opt/modules/.singularity/docker
> [6/6] |===================================| 100.0%
> Creating container runtime...
> ERROR  : Failed invoking the NEWUSER namespace runtime: Invalid argument
> ABORT  : Retval = 255

This may be the same issue as described in 
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/872

When I build and install RPM packages as described in 
http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux#build-an-rpm-from-source the 
example above runs without errors.

I happened to talk with Gregory M. Kurtzer <gmku...@gmail.com> at the 
SC17 conference in Denver, and he replied to me:
"I strongly suggest to install Singularity into the operating system rather 
then an environment module. We should update our documents accordingly to 
stress this as setting it up on shared storage is prone to problems."

Conclusion: The page http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux should be 
updated with Gregory's warning about installing Singularity as an 
environment module, and on an NFS server.
