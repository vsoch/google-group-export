The previous version is singularity 2.0.  I don't know about "that" as I
was just commenting on the description posted.  (Top posting doesn't
help.)

Documentation is a wonderful thing.  My previous example would have been
summarized as "Provides Scilab 5.5.2".

Yes; the only significant difference between a Fedora and Debian version
of the same thing is somewhat different size.

Machine learning?  Blimey.

The operating system is GNU/Linux, or possibly Busybox/Linux -- I don't
know of any other reasonable userland, but there probably is one.  The
distribution and its version is available from /etc for the ones I'm
familiar with (or directly with lsb_release, if that's installed).  If
you don't have a signature for the distribution, you're stuck, but then
it probably doesn't really matter.

??  If I need to know what's installed in the container, I presumably
have a package manager, unless it's busybox-based, but why should I
care, unless I'm using it as a general shell environment?

I don't know what "appropriate base OS" means or what you're trying to
do that isn't addressed by the description/definition file and possibly
the package manager package list if necessary.

If you think that different distributions create the same dependencies
for the same packages, think again, but I don't see why you need to
worry about it unless you need to optimize for space.
