Hi Adrian,

We're not using it in production yet, but I just did a quick test on one 
of our OpenPOWER systems and Singularity looks to work ok.

HOWEVER, your existing images (built for x86) are all made up of CPU 
instructions for x86 CPUs. You will need to build new images on a POWER 
system (compiling all the binaries for POWER8 CPUs). If you're lucky, 
your existing bootstrap definition files will get you most of the way 
there. If your definition files reference existing Docker images or 
binary files which were built for x86, there will be more effort.
