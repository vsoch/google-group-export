Hey Simone!

I think what is going on is what the error message indicates - it times out
and then gets killed. I want to suggest a different strategy - create a
base image that is served on Docker Hub, and then use *that* as a base for
the Singularity Hub build. Also make sure that you turn on debug mode in
your Builder Settings to get as much output as we can. Is that something we
can try?

Best,

Vanessa
