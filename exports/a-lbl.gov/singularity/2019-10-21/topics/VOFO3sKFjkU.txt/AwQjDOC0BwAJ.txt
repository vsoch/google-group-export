You mean something like this? :-)

[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ cat example.sspec
Name: R
Exec: echo "hello world"

%files
/usr/bin/R
/usr/bin/Rscript
[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ singularity --quiet build example.sspec
Running test...
Hello from within the container... (no test code defined)
WROTE: R.sapp
[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ ./R.sapp
hello world

[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ ln -sf R.sapp Rscript
[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ PATH=3D.:$PATH

[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ cat rtest.r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

sayHello <- function(){
   print('hello')
}

sayHello()
[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ ./rtest.r
[1] "hello"

[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ singularity run --cmd=3D/bin/sh R.sapp
singularity.R> exit


If so I obviously have it prototyped now... Still going over the
implementation and cleaning it up so I'll probably commit it within the
hour.
