Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity 2.4.3 is released!
To: singularity <singu...@lbl.gov>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="001a1142aab0cf3db605673a5f93"

I concur completely about the concerns with using Slack (or IRC for that
matter) for deciding and documenting important decisions. With that said,
it is generally used just to bring people up to speed with regards to
context and discussions which then get formally set in motion via PRs and
issues in GitHub.

To circle back to topic, the issue that was released with 2.4.3 needed a
resolution ASAP. The decision to have an immediate followup release (2.4.4)
was not driven by Slack consensus, it was mine. Regarding the branching
model of the GitHub repo, this also was not driven by a Slack discussion.
It was discussed and then proposed in our Hackathon to which everyone,
everywhere was invited to participate in physically (funded by Sylabs) or
virtually via Zoom.

It is our goal to be as inclusive as possible with regards to community
involvement. For user interaction and community support, I consider this
list and Slack the primary mechanisms. For development, the definitive
answer is GitHub (with everything else being supplementary). If this is not
sufficient, are there suggestions for fixing this; perhaps a dedicated
'singularity-devel' list?

Thanks!
