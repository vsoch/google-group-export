While I am very interested in hearing from anybody who has a strong opinion
about the Singularity license, I don't think a discussion will prove to be
helpful as I am not technically qualified to speak legally on the subject.
If anyone has questions regarding the motivation, specifics or anything
else regarding the license, I strongly encourage you (and/or your legal
council) to contact: I...@lbl.gov

Unfortunately and with my apologies, my attempt to help and clarify the
matter has only served to further confuse the issue. I will be taking my
opinions and interpretation down from the web pages. Please refer directly
to the source of licensing truth; the LICENSE file within the source code.

Thanks!
