As far as I can tell, all it's doing is making a load of work defeating
the effect, and breaking things where you haven't defeated it where they
may not show up immediately, and just cause problems.

People don't write shell scripts assuming -u, and I don't understand how
it could be any benefit, especially when you're not declaring variables
anyhow.  I can't see how it's a security feature, and I'd say it's the
opposite, since it causes bugs.

If there's somewhere you need to distinguish null and unset variables,
you could do it locally (if bash can't tell you directly -- I've never
needed to find out).

[Does Warewulf use set -u?  I know the NHC component doesn't.]
