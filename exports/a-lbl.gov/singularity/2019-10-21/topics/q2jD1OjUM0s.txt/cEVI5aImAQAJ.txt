Hi Michael,

This OverlayFS space is not actually part of the container image - it's not 
related to using `image.create` and specifying a size. The OverlayFS 
filesystem is created at runtime as a place that small changes at runtime 
can be written to (in RAM) and will be lost when the container exits. When 
running as an individual user it's 1MB. When running as root it can use up 
to ~50% of RAM on the machine.

This has been brought up in an issue 
here https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/1485 and there 
is documentation on how to create a persistent overlay here 
- https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/persistent_overlays.html . A 
persistent overlay can be used to provide more space if needed by a running 
image.

DT
