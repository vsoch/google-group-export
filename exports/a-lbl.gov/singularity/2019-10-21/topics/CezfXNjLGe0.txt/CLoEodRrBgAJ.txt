=================
As far as I understand the problem is that cuda-7.5 was built or relies on
nvidia 352.93 while I have NVIDIA driver 352.55 both on the host and
container. So far I could not find cuda-7.5 built with 352.55.
cuda-7.5 has stabs directory in which there is libcuda.so. The problem is
probably coming from there. However, I doubt I can just replace libcuda.so
in the stubs directory by a different version or turn it into symbolic link
to a different version in the driver? Because its size is much smaller than
the size of the real libcuda.so in the driver. So I suspect, it is really
only some kind of interface to the real library?

Thank you,
Igor

great answer for you. If seems like you are doing everything right, yet it =

 libcuda.so you are using. Notice how Python seems to correctly load libcud=
a.so, yet there is later an error that is unable to find libcuda.so. My fir=
st suspicion is that there is still a version mismatch between the drivers =
installed on the image and on the host. If you are sure that is not true, i=
t may be possible that the version of the driver that is installed on the m=
achine isn&#39;t new enough for the GPU. That actually occurred on our clus=
ter, and after a sysadmin updated the driver, it worked. Barring that I am =
not too sure. Maybe if you provide me with the full details of your install=
ation (the versions of the packages that you have installed, the OS of your=
 image and host), I might be able to think about something, but my suspicio=
n is that the driver version on your host machine may not be new enough.=C2=
