the structure to work with. 

I do remember some instructions on importing an image from a .tar.gz. I saw 
the instructions to create a blank container and then you could "import" a 
root filesystem stored as a .tar.gz. For some reason, I am not able to find 
those instructions. Is that feature still available? 

I could package up the vnfs into a tar.gz and then import it into a "blank" 
container.

<br>=C2=A0 &gt; not immediately clear what the difference is between run an=

<br>=C2=A0 A &#39;runscript&#39; is invoked when you do: =C2=A0singularity =

<br>=C2=A0 Similar functionality, but you could want different things to ha=

<br>&gt; Thanks for the quick reply. From reading that link, it seems that =
the functionality lost would be
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; 1) the ability to create custom run/start scripts (not immediately=
 clear what the difference is between run and start scripts, but I can chec=

<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; 2) Sourcing some default environment scripts
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; 3) For the &quot;libs&quot; feature, couldn&#39;t I make these hos=

<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; The most concerning is the &quot;action&quot; commands. We definit=
ely want the ability to call singularity exec &lt;command&gt; /image/to/vnf=
s/image. So far this seems to be working for us, but it&#39;s not clear if =
there will be any side effects.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; It seems like these scripts wouldn&#39;t be too hard to replicate,=
 though, from what you write. I could create them manually, I suppose. One =
thing we&#39;ve thought about doing was adding to Singularity a &quot;singu=
larity from vnfs&quot; feature that would properly invoke the metadata crea=
