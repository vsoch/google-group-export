Hello, I had asked this question on a previous thread a couple of days ago 
and got no response, so I thought I would create a new post. Here is what 
the issue is

Hello

So I went through the answers but there is something that is a little 
puzzling. I'm trying to convert a docker image to a Singularity container 
image. So I followed the process that the "singularity --help import" 
suggests by creating a tar file from the image using 
"docker save -o <tarfilename> <image file>

 and then  trying to convert it by using

sudo singularity import <singularityshell.img> <tarfilename>.

Tried various things including increasing the singularityshell.img size 
from default 768M to 2048M (the docker container is 732M in size)  but 
always got this error

Bootstrap initialization
No bootstrap definition passed, updating container
Executing Prebootstrap module
Executing Postbootstrap module
ERROR: Container does not contain the valid minimum requirement of /bin/sh

There was actually a /bin/sh in the docker container so I think this is 
some generic error.

I finally managed to do the conversion by running the image interactively 
and then doing this

docker export <containername> | sudo singularity import 
<singularityshell.img>

Am I doing something wrong while importing the tar file?

I did not try creating a local registry and pushing the image to it etc.

My question is why doesn't the tar method work??

Thanks

S
