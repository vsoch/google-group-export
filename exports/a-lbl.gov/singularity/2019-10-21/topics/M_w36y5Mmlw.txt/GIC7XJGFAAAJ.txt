<br>I&#39;d be inclined to write generally in terms of separate concerns:
<br>&quot;containing&quot; the necessary components required to run somethi=
ng
<br>c.f. maybe &quot;containing&quot; the behaviour of the processes when i=
t runs.
<br>
<br>&gt; Another question that could be added ? Can I run nested container =
within
<br>&gt; singularity ? (singularity in singularity or another container tec=
hs within
<br>&gt; singularity). It is used by lxd/lxc to run docker images as non-ro=
ot user.
<br>&gt; I think you can imagine some other use case.
<br>
<br>Right, related to the separation of concerns and how things compose.=C2=
=A0 As
<br>a simple example you could consider running singularity under, say,
<br>bubblewrap &lt;<a href=3D"https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap" =
rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://github.com/projectato<wbr>mic/bu=
bblewrap</a>&gt; (ignoring
<br>singularity --contain).
