Hi Stack,

First of all, you definitely should have a configuration file installed. If
you followed the exact build script from this mac install page
<http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-mac>, then your configuration should
actually be located at /usr/local/etc/singularity/singularity.conf. Try
checking the config file there, and make sure that it contains "user bind
control = yes".

Second, in order for mount points to work inside a container, you need to
make sure the directory exists in the container before you attempt to mount
it. In your .def file, make sure to include a "mkdir /data/" line inside
the %post script. Assuming that's done, please try the following command:
"singularity shell -B /data/:/data/ /path/to/container.img" and then check
if /data/ is mounted inside of the container now. If /data/ is still not
mounted in the container, please run the following command "singularity -d
shell -B /data/:/data/ /path/to/container.img" to get debug mode output
from Singularity, and paste everything it shows into a pastebin or similar
and share that with us.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

First the bug report. :-)<br>
<br>
When we were following the directions[1] for building on a Mac, it kept<br>
failing on the Git pull[2]. We had to remove the &#39;.git&#39; portion of =
the<br>
address before it would work. This was with the latest OSX with the<br>

<br>
<br>
Now for something I am stuck on...<br>
<br>
This is with the latest Git pull as of Monday.<br>
<br>
I built an Ubuntu Yakkety image with all the packages I need for my app.<br=
>
I created a /singularity executable file that only has this in it:<br>
#!/bin/bash -<br>
exec myapp &quot;$@&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
When I run the singularity container image, all works as expected. It<br>
behaves just as my app should. Except if you ask it to grab something<br>
out of our /data mount point...<br>
<br>
I can&#39;t seem to get it to work at all. I read the docs and searched the=
<br>
list, but none of what I found seems to work. It mounts /home, but not<br>
/data. I did ensure that /data was a folder in the image.<br>
<br>
I have attempted to place mount points in the /singularity script. There<br=
>
wasn&#39;t a singularity.conf file anywhere in the image but specifically<b=
r>
there wasn&#39;t a /etc/singularity/singularity.<wbr>conf. So I created one=
 and<br>
put in it &quot;bind path =3D /data&quot;. That didn&#39;t seem to work eit=
her.<br>
<br>
Can someone please help me figure out what I am missing?<br>
<br>
This particular build is quite specific to our environment, but I have a<br=
>
simple one that does the same thing that I can post if need be.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
