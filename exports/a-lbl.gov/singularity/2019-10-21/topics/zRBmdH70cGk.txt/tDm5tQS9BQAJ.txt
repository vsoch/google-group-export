Any chance you happen to have /tsd/p158/home/p158-uxscti as your home
directory on the cluster?
  
Based on the fact that it's failing to mount /tsd/p158/home/p158-uxscti 
as    
home, I suspect Singularity is assuming this to be your home on the
cluster, but, you mkdir -p it in the container.

So, remove that line, but keep the "mkdir /tsd" since that creates the    
mount point for your home on the cluster.
  
HTH,
