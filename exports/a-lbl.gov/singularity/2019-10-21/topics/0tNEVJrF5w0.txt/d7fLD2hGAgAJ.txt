Hi Greg,

I would vote for having the dependency resolution component available in v2
as well, could it be perhaps an option to InstallFile?
The reason I liked it is because it enabled us to extract the very minimal
set of libraries we needed for an application, instead of installing all
the dependency packages (which can be several GBs if you are using things
like some of the OpenHPC packages).

Also, my impression is that the requirement for specifying files one-by-one
would make the whole thing look much more like appc.

Thanks,
Balazs
