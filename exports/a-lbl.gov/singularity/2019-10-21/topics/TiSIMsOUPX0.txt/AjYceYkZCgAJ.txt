I think Jenkins would need self hosting, while Travis or Circle CI are
hosted by the respective companies. I've never tried MPI on either, but it
looks like it's possible - here is a python module that uses it, and sets
it up in the travis.yml:

https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py/blob/master/.travis.yml#L19

It might make sense to break apart the current test.sh into different kinds
of tests (each test coirresponds to a line in the config file and is run in
an isolated environment). It also seems like there are different kinds of
testing, which ultimately we would want to better define,. For example, I
would want there to be some kind of validation / testing for specific
images, so I can make an image and know immediately if it's valid (or
produces an error), There also would be different tests for running
singularity in different environments, for each of the commands in the
test.sh. Perhaps a good start would be for, anyone that has done some of
this "manual" testing, to write up some snippets into files for others to
see, and we can think of how to organize / group and set up in travis?
