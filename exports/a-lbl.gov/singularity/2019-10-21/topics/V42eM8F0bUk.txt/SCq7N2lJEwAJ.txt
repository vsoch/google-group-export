Hi Peter,

The Exec directive works a bit different (but I like your intuitive usage o=
f it so I'm thinking how to support hat model). At present exec doesn't tak=
e any arguments, only a path to a single binary.=20

You can do two things at present to achieve what (I think) you are trying t=
o do.=20

1. Remove the arguments from the exec line and call them by hand when you r=
un the SAPP.=20

2. Introduce a "%runscript" to your spec file that has in it the full comma=
nd you want to run (e.g. What you presently have in your Exec line). Additi=
onally you can remove your Exec line (but you don't have to) and put the pa=
th to the touch binary in a "%files" section.=20

I can go into more details when I'm on a full keyboard if necessary. Let me=
 know if what i said made sense (typing on an iPhone keyboard makes soundin=
g smart hard LOL).=20

Hope that helps!
