Thanks for the quick responses! I'm looking for URL's or summaries
comparing Singularity and bare metal (Docker comparison are a bonus :)  ).
Primarily I'm looking for CPU oriented codes with not much IO. However, I'm
also looking for results for GPU based codes and for MPI based codes with
results using more than one node.

Thanks a million!

Jeff
