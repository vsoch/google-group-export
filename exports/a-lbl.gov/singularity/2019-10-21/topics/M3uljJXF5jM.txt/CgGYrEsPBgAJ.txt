Hi Vang,

Unfortunately yes, this is exactly equivalent to giving members of that
group full and unrestricted sudo access. A user who can run `singularity
build *` as root can run arbitrary commands as the root user on the host
from within the `%setup` section of the definition file. There is no safe
workaround to allow users to build images from a definition file when they
are not trusted to have full root access on the system.
