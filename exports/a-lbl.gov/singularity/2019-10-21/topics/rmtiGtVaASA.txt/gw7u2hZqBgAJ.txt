Hi all,

  We're working on a change, but trying to come up with the best way
to do it. We don't want to purposefully break the RC packages by
making the version something like:

    2.4.6rc2

  From RPM (and it appears Debian) versioning, that would be:  2.4.6 <
2.4.6rc2  ... so you couldn't have an RC package and "update" to a
full release as the actual release package is seen as older than the
RC with how the versioning is compared.

  So....  We can short circuit the RPM .spec file by explicitly
setting _rel as something like 0.2  (for RC2). But, will the same work
for debian/changelog if I put in 2.4.6-0.2, or will it ignore the
'0.2' and use a default, or only look at the first digit?

-J
