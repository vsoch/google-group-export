Hey guys,

I've heard many times that Singularity has a nice support in Open MPI 2.0, 
but could someone describes how exactly such integration affects the 
execution of MPI application? Older Open MPI and MPICH work in SAPP as 
well, so I don't really get what Open MPI 2.0 brings us.

Moreover I see MPI support in Singularity is positioned as one of the 
features that is implemented better than in Shifter (correct?). But Shifter 
also allows to run MPI apps, well, at least I see Cray runs MPICH in 
Shifter's chroot (not sure about Open MPI though). Could you explain please 
what is the difference (if any) between running, say, MPICH with 
Singularity vs running it in Shifter (from HPC prospective of course)?

Best regards,

Taras
