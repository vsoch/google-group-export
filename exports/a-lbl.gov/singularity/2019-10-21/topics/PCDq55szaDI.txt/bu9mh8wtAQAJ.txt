Sorry for my late reply.

how reproducible it is? Does it need to be reproducible?

Currently our goal is mainly to overcome the differences between the 
development (Ubuntu 16.04) and production environment (RHEL 6).
In our situation, it is hard to have the admins change the cluster 
configuration, and I find myself continuously building libraries and 
compilers from source.

> Yeah! If "composing" means building with services, I would bet that 
something is already in the world. The Sylabs guys can comment more on that!

Cool, in this case I decided to open this issue 
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/1543> on github. Let 
see if it sparkles some interest.

Vanessa, thank you very much for your precious tips: I will experiment a 
bit more with Singularity and explore the possibility offered by the 
Registry and the Hub, to see what best fits our workflow!
