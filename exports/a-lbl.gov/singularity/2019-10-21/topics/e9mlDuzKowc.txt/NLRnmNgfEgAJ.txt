Hi,

Just to fill in some details on this for those interested, having resumed 
looking at this post-Christmas....

In my (VM) test environment, the obvious indicators are that the docker 
container is running non-privilege (I'm even starting docker with 
--privileged=false) and docker inspect is showing:

[root@centos7base ~]# docker inspect --format='{{.HostConfig.Privileged}}' 
test-docker
false

However, within the container, things are a bit different - using an 
approach suggested 
at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32144575/how-to-know-if-a-docker-container-is-running-in-privileged-mode 
specifically the following, seems to indicate I have at least some 
privilege. I guess that is why singularity works here.

ip link add dummy0 type dummy >/dev/nullif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    PRIVILEGED=true
    # clean the dummy0 link
    ip link delete dummy0 >/dev/nullelse
    PRIVILEGED=falsefi


On my real production servers, the docker inspect comes back the same, but 
the above code errors with "Operation not permitted".

I've only recently started looking at Docker and singularity, so I need to 
do a little more investigation i.e. is there some global Docker setting 
impacting here or is there something within the container that allows this? 

Either way, as things stand it is a no go in my production environment, 
which is a real shame.

Thanks anyway,

Chris
