Hi David,

Yup - that's an important (and tough!) use case, although separate from the=
 thread at hand.  Jordi was originally concerned with the case where a user=
 outside the container manipulated the raw filesystem image in a manner tha=
t triggered an unknown security bug.

Portable applications that listen on the network are a whole other ball of =
yarn compared to launching batch jobs, for precisely the reasons you descri=
be. I don't think the community has great solutions (yet!!).

Locally, we don't allow unprivileged users start network services on the cl=
uster computing resources; if a service needs to be run within campus, we'd=
 rather the user partner with the administrators.
