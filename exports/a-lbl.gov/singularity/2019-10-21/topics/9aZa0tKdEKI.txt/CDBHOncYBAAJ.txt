Hmm well, I tried adding the library to nvliblist.conf and reloaded the 
module.  I also tried setting SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  And I get 
the same error when running:

singularity run --nv ${WORK}/bipbids_gpu.simg ${WORK}/Data 
${WORK}/Data/derivatives participant --participant_label 327 --stages bip 
--tract arc_r --gpu yes --skip_bids_validator

It is looking more like I will have to add /cm/shared as a bind location in 
singularity.conf and have her include that in her recipe.  Thoughts?
Thanks for the help
Chris

<br>&gt; Hi
<br>&gt; I&#39;m trying to help my user who is getting this message:
<br>&gt; probtrackx2_gpu: error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.s=
o.7.5:
<br>&gt; cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory...
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; She created a singularity container by pulling a Dockerfile, which=
 I could

<br>&gt; In this Dockerfile it calls the cuda4singularity code.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; She submits it as a PBS job including &quot;module load cuda75&quo=

<br>&gt; library path to:
<br>&gt;
