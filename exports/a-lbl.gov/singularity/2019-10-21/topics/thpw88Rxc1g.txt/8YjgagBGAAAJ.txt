I'd really like to to have my home directory reside within the container. 
 So many dot files quietly affect the runtime behavior of applications that 
it's quite difficult to guarantee a consistent environment when a container 
runs on systems with different home directories.

The -H option allows you to specify a unique mapping from the host system 
into the container, but what I'd really like is to specify a directory 
within the container as the actual home directory, not the target of a 
mapping.

Is this possible?

Thanks,

Chris
