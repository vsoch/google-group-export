FWIW: it would seem that having drivers in a container is going to be an is=
sue. The driver has to not only =E2=80=9Cfit=E2=80=9D with the OS, but also=
 the firmware level of the hardware itself. I don=E2=80=99t see how that ca=
n be portable as you are bound to run into mismatches, but perhaps I=E2=80=
=99m missing something...
