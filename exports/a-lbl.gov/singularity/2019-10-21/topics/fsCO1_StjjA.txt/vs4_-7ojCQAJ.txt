I do not know the backed architecture of MPICH as well as I do Open MPI, bu=
t with the OMPI integration there is no need to include any OFED support wi=
thin the container because that is all part of the host specific informatio=
n which is managed via the Orted process outside the container. I would hav=
e though that MPICH works in a similar manner even though it is not modular=
. But I can't say for sure.

Thanks for the findings!

Have you had a chance to test v2 yet?
