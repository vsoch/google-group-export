Like said before, I think your package is installed in your HOME, that is
why het that behaviour. Indeed, by default, the HOME is shared between your
host and your container.
Did you add the flag '--user' to your pip install or do you use pyenv or
virtualenv or another thing (conda ?) ?

Best regards
Remy
