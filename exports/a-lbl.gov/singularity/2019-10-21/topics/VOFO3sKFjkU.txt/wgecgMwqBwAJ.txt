Ohh, do you mean multiple commands within the SAPP that are not in a single
given workflow?

If so you could hack it for now and do something like:

   $ echo "command with arguments" | singularity shell container-name

But that isn't ideal. Tell me some more about the use case and what you
envision the command line syntax looking like.

Thanks!
