Yes,

I am running it with --nv flag. The error is:

2019-04-24 11:47:44.607319: E 
tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:300] failed call to cuInit: 
CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE: no CUDA-capable device is detected

2019-04-24 11:47:44.607353: I 
tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_diagnostics.cc:150] kernel driver does 
not appear to be running on this host (plvimphctrl1): 
/proc/driver/nvidia/version does not exist

https://singularity-hub.org/collections/320
This is the base recipe file i used, and to it I added a few more 
dependencies and code needed for my program to run. (Attached my recipe 
file in previous message)
