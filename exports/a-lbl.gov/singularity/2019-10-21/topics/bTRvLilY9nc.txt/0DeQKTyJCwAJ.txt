Ah, your email pointed me in the right direction. Arch mounts / as a normal
read-write disk partition, but it mounts /tmp as an in-memory tmpfs.
Unmounting /tmp fixes the problem.

There is a question of why setting SINGULARITY_TMPDIR to a different path
(on the actual disk partition, rather than /tmp) doesn't fix this problem,
but that's beyond what I need. My immediate problem is solved.

Thanks a lot for your help!
Dmitriy

<div>Hi Justin,</div>
<div><br></div>
I&#39;m using ArchLinux, under qemu, running on a macOS host. But the issue=
 is clearly memory. Singularity seems to take half of the available memory =
for its tmpfs /, and that&#39;s just not enough in my case for CUDA. How mu=
ch memory does your computer or VM have? What does df -h output while you a=
re building the image?
<div><br></div>
<div>And back to my original question: is it possible to tell it to not use=
 memory for /?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div>Dmitriy</div>

<div>I did not have any issue building this in my centos 7 VM. How are you =
building yours? In a VM? Which os?<br>

<div>I have a possibly strange setup. I&#39;m running Linux in a VM on a Ma=
c and trying to build an image of ArchLinux. The definition file is below. =
In this definition I&#39;m trying to add cuda, which is what causes the pro=
blem: things break because / is out of space. There is enough space on the =
disk (/dev/sda2), but / is mounted in memory and it doesn&#39;t have the re=

<div>I&#39;ve tried using the sandbox mode, but it too seems to go through =
