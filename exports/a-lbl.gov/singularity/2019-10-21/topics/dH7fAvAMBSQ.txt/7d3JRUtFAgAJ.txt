The possibility to change this in the configuration file would be very 
convenient for us.
We're testing singularity on our cluster and were surprised that these file 
are stored in roots home.
I'm totally aware of the fact, that for the normal user creates the 
container on their local machine and uploads the container afterward to the 
cluster, but sometimes we are testing things directly on the cluster.

Another question:
Why is the cache not removed? I don't think that the files in the cache 
directory are needed after bootstrapping. Am I right?
Or is the cache used if a new Singularity container gets bootstrapped from 
the same Docker image?

Cheers,

Felix
