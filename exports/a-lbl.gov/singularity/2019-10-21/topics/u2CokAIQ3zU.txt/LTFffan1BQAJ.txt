I've solved one (stupid) problem and exchanged it for another. The reason
that it didn't seem to matter what settings I changed is while I was
messing with the correct config file, I had written the LMOD module to look
at the wrong version of Singularity. Now that I got that cleared up I'm
getting actual errors about "Could not mount Singularity overlay: No such
device" which I expect is more of a system problem than a Singularity
problem. I'll keep digging into this, I appreciate anyone who even thought
about giving me advice, some Mondays are even more Monday than others.
