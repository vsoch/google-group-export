Hi Yong,

Sorry for delayed response. After comparing bootstrap/build code, I don't=
=20
see major changes between bootstrap/build when creating container into=20
directory,
so this bug should appear even with bootstrap command, does the following=
=20
bootstrap fail ? :

$ sudo mkdir /nfs/sandbox
$ sudo singularity bootstrap /nfs/sandbox centos7.def

Best,
C=C3=A9dric

Hi C=C3=A9dric,
<br>
<br>Thanks for the explanation and that&#39;s exactly what I thought. The
<br>reason why I wanted to raise it as an issue is,
<br>
<br>1. The old &quot;bootstrap&quot; command is fine and doesn&#39;t genera=
te an error.
<br>Although I do lose the capabilities on ping but that&#39;s fine and I k=
now
<br>it and know how to fix it at a later time, which is not a big deal.
<br>But &quot;build&quot; command failed really hard on this made me think =
it could
<br>be somehow related to Singularity, or at least the differences between
<br>&quot;bootstrap&quot; and &quot;build&quot; on NFS.
<br>
<br>2. I don&#39;t think this is a plain cpio&#39;s fault as if you try to
<br>manually extract files then they are fine (capabilities aside). But
<br>the &quot;build&quot; command would extract a file with wrong filename =
which is
<br>beyond me,
<br>
<br>&gt;&gt; [root@nfs0 bin]# ls -l ping\;5a39b947
<br>&gt;&gt; -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 66176 Aug =C2=A04 01:01 ping;5a39b947
<br>
<br>Note that little tail &quot;\;5a39b947&quot; was appended after the ext=
raction.
<br>This is the exact reason that caused the &quot;build&quot; process to f=
ail I
<br>think since &quot;bootstrap&quot; extracts the correct filename.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>

<br>&gt; Hello,

<br>&gt; This error is caused by file capabilities (cap_set_file), CentOS 7=
 use file

<br>&gt;&gt; Hi,
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m running into a problem that I need some help with.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to build a sandbox directory with Singularity 2=
.4.2 on NFS
<br>&gt;&gt; and am getting the following error. The command is,
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; singularity build -s /nfs/sandbox centos-7.def
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; ...
<br>&gt;&gt; Error unpacking rpm package iputils-20160308-10.el7.x86_64

<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; If I switch back to the old &quot;bootstrap&quot; command it&#=

if I
