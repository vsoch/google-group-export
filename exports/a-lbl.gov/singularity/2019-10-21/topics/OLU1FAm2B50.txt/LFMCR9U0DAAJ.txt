It turns out that we the sudo that we wrap around singularity command was 
still calling 2.2.1, after explicitly calling 2.3 the problem went away. 
But, thanks to Stefan for the info on the /.singularity.d, which is useful 
to know about, and, it led me to the find out the real problem (as 2.2.1 
does not have this directory).
