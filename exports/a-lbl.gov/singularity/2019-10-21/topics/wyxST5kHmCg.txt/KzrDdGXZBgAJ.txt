Hey Kevin,

This is great! I just took it for a spin, and here are some suggestions.

1. You did a great job with the README.md!
2. Do you intend for the repo to be a teaching tool? if so I would also
write (and explain) the two commands in the build and run scripts in the
README.md, and explain to the user what you are doing.
3. If you intend to build the recipe on Singularity Hub, the format should
be like Singularity.<tag> recipe.Singularity mightl be found, but it
wouldn't work to add a tag.
4. if users will be using the container on some cluster (or anywhere else
with a .local folder in home) this might conflict with some set of packages
installed in the container. Anyway, if they get weird bugs related to
packages / versions on the path, it's worth knowing about PYTHONUSERSITE
<https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONNOUSERSITE> and
similar variables (although it looks like your demo notebook is in R, so
not relevant here!)
5. Make sure that the user knows that the notebook itself is external to
the container - it's a way to provide a reproducible *environment* for
working with notebooks, but the notebook itself (separate from the
container) is not reproducible without the container.

Actually, just put my money where my mouth is
<https://github.com/kkmann/jupyter-singularity-demo/pull/1> and helped with
a few of these details :) Solid work!

Best,

V

<div>Hi Kevin,<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 &gt; the build process (singularity build ...) IS completely isolate=
d<br>
=C2=A0 Sort of... We mount /tmp during the %post section. But IIRC, that is=
 it.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 One thing you may be able to do is use a sandbox image. So, you<br>
could do something like:<br>
<br>
--- start cut ---<br>
sudo singularity build --sandbox singularity-container-image<br>
singularity-container-image.def<br>
sudo singularity shell --writable singularity-container-image/<br>
=C2=A0 [ setup your container in the shell ]<br>
sudo singularity build singularity-container-image.sif<br>
singularity-container-image/<br>
--- end cut<br>
<br>
So, you create a sandbox (directory) image that can be writable. Do<br>
whatever setup you need, and then make the read-only SIF image. If<br>
your issue is just that the files from your $HOME are overwriting the<br>
global config, you can run with the `--no-home` option. This will not<br>
mount your home, but it will mount your working directory still ... so<br>
if your working directory is in your HOME, that gets mounted, even<br>
though the reset of your HOME does not.<br>
