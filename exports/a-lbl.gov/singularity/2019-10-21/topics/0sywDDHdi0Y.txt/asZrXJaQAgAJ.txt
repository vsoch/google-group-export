Apparently not by any version we would have installed, though.  [I often
wonder if OMPI people understand the implications for services of being
told to run a live development version which is incompatible with
everything else on the system, or potentially installable on the
system.]

When I tracked down the MCA module and tried to figure out what it was
doing in the new, undocumented framework, it appeared to be supporting
singularity v1.  Given the instability of OMPI, I don't see how to keep
things in sync for an HPC service.  In principle, as I understand it, a
singularity distribution could bundle a compatible MCA module, but it
would likely be compatible with few OMPI versions.

Of course I don't mean to flame, I still think OMPI is the best option
after surveying them and pushing for it originally, and I'm grateful to
people working on it, but the maintenance is frustrating for people
running a service.  I know I should get back to the OMPI list and say
things there, even if it's not effective.

I don't see that.  See the following.
