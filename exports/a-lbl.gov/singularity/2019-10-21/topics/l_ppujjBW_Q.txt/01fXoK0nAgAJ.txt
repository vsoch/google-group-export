Stupid me. The differentiation between containers is done at the PID level.
As a quick test I ran two identical CentOS7 containers, each with a
different TOML file specifiying cpus = 1 and cpus =2
Separate cgroups were set up named singularity/$PID1  and singularity/$PID2
The expected cpusets were listed in the cgroups.
test.
The take home from this - run a complete test. Dont run one instance then
extrapolate what you think is happening.
As Richard Feynman said - you are the easiest person to fool.
