Hi Grigory,

There maybe other things going on as well but try to run it without the ref=
erence to 'pwd'.=20

This is because pwd always provides a fully qualified path (e.g. It starts =
with /). Paths that start with / will always resolve to inside the containe=
r (unavoidable without doing some serious trickery).=20

Let me know what happens from there.=20

Gregory
