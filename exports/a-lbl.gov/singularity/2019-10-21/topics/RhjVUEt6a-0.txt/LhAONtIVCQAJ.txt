Hi Lito
   Thanks for the reply. The reason I did not dabble with the bootstrap 
method was because I had a docker container on which some specific software 
had been installed.and I did that by creating a basic container and then 
installing this software on it and then creating a new image which had the 
installed software.  I didn't want to go through that process, initially, 
with Singularity. I needed to quickly demo some stuff to show SIngularity's 
strengths. Hence the question.
