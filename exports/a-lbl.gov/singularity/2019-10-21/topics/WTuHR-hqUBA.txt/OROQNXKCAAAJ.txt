Subject: Building OMPI from git master - discussion

I saw M Noons post entitled "Cant find or run installed APP from within the
container"
This set me thinking...

Quite often on HPC mailing lists one sees people who want to use MPI
commenting that "I have installed the distro-provided RPMs..." - this
usually makes my blood run cold,
as these tend to be up to date Ubuntu or CentOS distros which is OK, or if
we are very unlucky some manky old Redhat flavour (as an aside people DO
insist on using older distros, as they have the mantra that 'Linux can
revive old hardware as it takes less resources').  I digress.

Using the distro-supplied MPI variety is to me a bad idea - MPIs are not at
the same level of integration/maturity as (say) Apache HTTP servers - MPI
is still evolving, and there are of course the optimised MPIs for Mellanox
/ Omnipath.

The approach of running a git clone of the master release of OpenMPI then
compiling that seems to me to be a good idea. At first I though - but then
you won't have a deterministic version.
I guess this is fine - and in fact is an advantage of containerisation, as
logn as you knwo what version you have in this container.

This further leads me to ponder the status of HPC software in general. I
will stick my neck out here and say that the 'webscale generation' expect
software to be well packaged, and to be well tested with the particular
Linux distro you are using.
I really don't think anyone woudl download and compile Apache (for
instance) from source these days. I may we  be wrong.

Even then, if you are searching for a particular package you would (say)
enable the EPEL repository in Redhat/Centos/Fedora, or another repo which
you know has an updated version of the package you need.


HPC software on the other hand is very much a more moveable feast.
Looking at the STAR application which M Noon uses, of course you have to
download this from a Git repository as it is updated frequently.

I guess this though brings me back to saying that containerisation again
has the advantage here - you are packagin up a known working version of
application X.

I further gues sI am preaching to the converted here, but woudl be
interested in your thoughts.
