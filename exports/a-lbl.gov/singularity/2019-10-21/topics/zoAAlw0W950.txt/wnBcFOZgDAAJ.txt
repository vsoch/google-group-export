Hi Jai,

  You can find the base environment setup at (default location):

      /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bootstrap-scripts/environment.tar

  That also includes some other stuff in it to make bind mounting
easier so be careful with it. All directories are prepended with a '.'
though so it's somewhat safer.

pts

  A 'runscript' is invoked when you do:  singularity run [image]  ...
or you run a image directly like: ./image_name.img
  A 'startscript' is invoked when you use instances, and you run:
singularity instance.start [image] [name]

  Similar functionality, but you could want different things to happen
between when you 'start' an instance, and when you 'run' it.

  > For the "libs" feature, couldn't I make these host system libs

  This '/.singularity.d/libs' directory is used with the `--nv` flag
for bringing in the host nVidia libraries. I think it does a bind
mount of the libraries to that location.
