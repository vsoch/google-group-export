Hi Singularities,

I piped my --debug to a file as in:
/xyz/singularity/3.1.0/bin/singularity --debug run my_container.sif > & 
debug_singularity.log

It includes the ANSI characters that are responsible for the pretty colors 
to my terminal.  However, in the file they are annoying.

May I request that singularity --debug distinguish and change its behavior 
accordingly?
If that makes sense to do, you might consider an option like what `ls` 
provides '--color=always'

Reference:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/10823/where-do-my-ansi-escape-codes-go-when-i-pipe-to-another-process-can-i-keep-them

If this is something worth considering I'd be happy to create a github 
issue but I wanted to check in with you all first.

Robert
