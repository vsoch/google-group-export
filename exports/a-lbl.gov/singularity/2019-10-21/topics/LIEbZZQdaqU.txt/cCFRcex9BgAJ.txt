Hi Greg,

I think overall the Singularity documentation is good, what I found 
missing when learning it is mainly the tricks, like the return value 
catching, and good examples.

I am creating two sets of documentation for our purposes, one user facing 
for how to use existing containers and how to build basic ones, and 
another more internal for our staff and the power users - where I am 
compiling all the tricks and quirks I have encountered, including 
container definitions examples. I'll share the links once I get all the 
repos set up (need to find a few uninterrupted hours to move things around 
in the Singularity Hub format).

The other tricky part when I started was to find good definitions files 
examples. There were not many links from Singularity website to those. 
Thankfully I ran across Vanessa's website that helped, and, now with 
Singularity Hub up it's fairly easy to find a close enough example for 
what one needs. Though, with the amount of containers on the hub growing 
finding a good example may be harder, which is why my plan is to provide 
about 5 base container definitions to users to use as a start (base, GPU, 
MPI/IB stack, Python,...).

I'll post this up here when it's ready.

Thanks for all the good work, both Singularity and the Hub are great. I 
see a lot of potential in Singularity in empowering users to deploy the 
applications themselves.

MC
