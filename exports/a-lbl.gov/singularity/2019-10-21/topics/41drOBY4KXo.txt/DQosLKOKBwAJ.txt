Pull means dumping the layers into a Singularity image, no special
customization, and build corresponds with the old bootstrap, which may add
extra bits if using a Singularity Recipe.

For Singularity 2.4 what is the difference between pull & build when using

This is quasi true - there are a few number of "legacy" images on
singularity hub that had migrations requested, and all of the images on the
previous hub (now hosted at doc.fish) are going to be no longer available
at the end f the year. The new Singularity Hub will not be building any
legacy images (prior to 2.4).

build for a singularity hub image would mean using a singularity image as a
base. For a docker image it means dumping the layers into an empty base.
Pull for singularity hub however you are correct - you are pulling a single
image as is, no "building" done.

Yes a pull/build of Docker always means needing to re-assemble those
layers, whether they are from the registry or in your cache. This is why it
would be wise to use singularity images, and not expect docker layers to
always be available / the same.
