SINGULARITY_SOMENAME doesn't seem to pass the arbitrary variables at all, 
unlike SINGULARITYENV_SOMENAME.

when SINGULARITYENV_SOMENAME is unset this reveals a another issue as 
well...

If inside %environment you set a variable as you would in /etc/environment 
(without "export"), it doesn't become part of the environment without 
SINGULARITYENV_SOMENAME set.

Concrete example:
BootStrap: docker
From: alpine:latest

%environment
HELLOWORLD="Inside %environment"

%setup
 echo $HELLOWORLD
 echo "HELLOWORLD='Hello variable from %setup'" >> 
$SINGULARITY_ROOTFS$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT

%post
  source $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT
  echo $HELLOWORLD
  rm $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT

%runscript
  exec echo $HELLOWORLD


$ # After the build
$ singularity run test

$ # It did not print anything
$ export SINGULARITYENV_HELLOWORLD="From the host"
$ singularity run test
Inside %environment

If you add export in the %environment then it prints 
Inside %environment
in the first instance where it had been blank, as one might expect. In the 
second case it appears to be loading the %environment script after 
SINGULARITYENV_HELLOWORLD meaning end users do not have the ability to 
override what's in %environment.

The situation where %environment doesn't act exactly like /etc/environment 
might be just fine as long as people always use export.
