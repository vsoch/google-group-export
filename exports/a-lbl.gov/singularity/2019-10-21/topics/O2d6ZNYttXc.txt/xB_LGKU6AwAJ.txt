In addition to Brian's comments, we have been thinking about this already
and to prelude some coming features, this should be mitigated via signed
containers, and optionally enabling the system administrator to disallow
containers to run which have not been signed. You could also enable
Singularity to only "trust" and allow use of containers that are owned by a
particular user, or residing in a particular path.

Additionally a maliciously derived container image should be caught by the
kernel FS driver else that is a kernel bug... Granted we are enabling that
vector, and will work with upstream kernel developers and Linux
distributions to ensure that the operating systems have been fixed
properly. To my knowledge this has not happened (yet) and there is plenty
of precedent in distributing images (ISO, SquashFS, etc..) already.

A few ways to think about the issue:<br>
<br>
0) Any time you allow arbitrary code execution on a Linux host, there<br>
