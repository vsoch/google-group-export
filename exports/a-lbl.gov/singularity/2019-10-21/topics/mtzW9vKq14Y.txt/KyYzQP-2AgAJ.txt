Hey Paul,

This is a cool question! Singularity Compose
<https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-compose/#/> will make
generation of multiple containers much easier, but I haven't thought about
static ip - the addresses are on a bridge and assigned to that namespace.
There are a couple of things I think we could try. if you are okay with the
bridge, then you would just want to ask for the same address on it
consistently. If you want to define your own network configuration, I think
what you could try is to create a custom configuration in
*/usr/local/etc/singularity/network*/ (for example, the bridge uses
00_bridge.conflist) and then you could start the container using that
configuration, and give it the ip address that you want. I haven't tried
this myself, but it might be useful to read about CNI
<https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md>. If you
get an example working, or if just a consistent ip on the bridge would
work, I'd be happy to add the functionality to Singularity Compose so it
can handle the customizations for you.

Best,

Vanessa
