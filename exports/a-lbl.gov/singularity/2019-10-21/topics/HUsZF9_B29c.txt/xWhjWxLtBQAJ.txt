I am trying to install Fluent 16 application into singularity image.
It can be installed successfully and the Fluent application launcher can be 
run successfully.
But when I move the singularity image to HPC environment. I got MPI issue.
In singularity document.  It recommends to launch application like this:
==========

mpirun -np 20 singularity exec /tmp/Centos-7.img /usr/bin/ring


===========

But Fluent 16 has its own MPI. Fluent alway launch the MPI by itself. So I 
can't run MPI  as description in the singularity document.
When Fluent try to launch MPI,  it would make all computing nodes run some 
MPI commands to setup MPI environment. 
For the case without container,
It would be no problem. Since the MPI commands are under the path of Fluent 
installation directory which are available for all other computing nodes.
But for the case that Fluent was installed inside the container.   The MPI 
commands  are  the paths inside of  the container, They are not available 
for other 
computing nodes. So Fluent is always failed at the MPI environment setup.

Does anyone meet this issue?  What's the advice for this case ?

Thanks
