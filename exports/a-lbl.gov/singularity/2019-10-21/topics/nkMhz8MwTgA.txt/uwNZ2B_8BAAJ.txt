Hi Grigory!

Think of the bootstrap'ing process to be a two stage process. The first
stage is to create a core operating system that you can then extend upon in
the %post. So with that perspective, only use the InstallPkgs keyword to
install any core components that are critical for the second stage to
process. In general this would be minimal if anything. So for example, in
RHEL based systems, you have to include 'yum' otherwise a standard
bootstrap doesn't assume to include it, and you will need `yum` to install
additional packages after the core system has been created.

The second stage then can be accomplished generally within the %post
scriptlet. Here is where you will add your additional repositories, and
call apt-get update/install to install more packages.

Hopefully that helps!

Greg
