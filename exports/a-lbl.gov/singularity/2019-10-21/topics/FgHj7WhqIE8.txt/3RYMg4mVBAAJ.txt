Hiya Kenneth,

You raise good points. I'd say let's keep this open for the next few days,
but so far the response has been totally, completely unanimous in favor of
holding back all releases so they don't land on the end of the week!

Just to reiterate, I/we are happy to comply with whatever works the best
for the users, so just tell us what works best!

Thanks!

    As I already mentioned in the Singularity Slack channel: I (heavily)
    support Lars&#39; view on this.<br>
    <br>
    Both Singularity 2.4.6 and 2.5.0 were announced late Friday
    afternoon/evening CEST, which basically rules out quickly reacting
    to the announcement.<br>
    A lot of sites are quite careful to deploying changes on a Friday
    (let alone over the weekend) to avoid unintended/unwanted side
    effects that affect production.<br>
    <br>
    I understand your point of view, but I think you can argue both ways
    on this...<br>
    It&#39;s hard to be sure which approach is better, but my gut feeling
    tells me that a public announcement is likely to draw more
    attention, and thus may (slightly) increase the risk of exploiting
    known security bugs when they&#39;re disclosed at a bad time. Projects
    like OpenSSL know this well I think, I&#39;ve certainly noticed them
    paying attention to it.<br>
    <br>
    Please consider announcing these similar releases in the future at a
    different time of the week, e.g. early/mid working week week
    (Mon-Wed makes sense I think), and preferably with a
    pre-announcement of an upcoming release a couple of days up front
    (so that the update can be planned).<br>
    <br>
    In addition, I think it would be great if a separate
    announcement/security mailing list could be created for Singularity,
    which is low traffic.<br>
    That way, people/sites can subscribe only/also to that, so that
    security (pre-)announcements pop into view as soon they are made
    (rather than being buried in a folder that is only checked once in a
    while due to heavier traffic).<br>
