There is nothing specific about the OMPI integration that is specific for S=
ingularity aside from runtime optimizations (like the staging you mentioned=
). That code can be found currently in the OMPI v2.(1/0.1) development bran=
ch. That staging is not necessary with Singularity v2, but there are some o=
ther optimizations that Ralph and I have been brainstorming.=20

With that said, what makes Singularity an appealing container system for MP=
I integration is it's workflow and container bootstrapping model which make=
s it easily compatible with things like MPI's PMI among other things like X=
11.=20
