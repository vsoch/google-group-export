Once we have data containers, and Singularity has support for services, it
plugs in seamlessly to run workflows, and more complicated applications
that have different services with reliance on one another (eg, more than a
single thing run as a job on a cluster). At face value, it seems like more
of a "commercial" use case, but given that a scientific tool is (or should
be) like an any other modern, web-based tools (eg, having some kind of
application, separate database, APIs, workers, etc) this is a good
direction for scientific products to go. We don't want just single
containers, we want legos that can be put together in different ways to
make different pipelines.
