Thanks Vanessa! 

oh wow, I didn't expect this to be so much of a problem. Shouldn't there be 
an option for singularity build to ignore everything in the user home 
except the singularity config file itself? 
Might not have been entirely clear from my initial post, but I do want all 
build steps to write files in the /home of my container image to get 
complete isolation (copying stuff from my home after build is rather a last 
resort ;)).
I mean, that behaviour seems super weird considering that singularity puts 
reproducibility on its flag - its not even explicitly mentioned in the docs!
I had an issue with R complaining about missing localization files on our 
HPC before - kinda get why now...

1. is also problematic since --writable is denoted a legancyformat (so 
probably not a good idea to depend on that). Sandbox mode seems awefully 
complicated (I do not want to build my container interactively ;)) 
How weird would it be if the only option to get a reproducible singularity 
container was by first building a docker container (fully isolated) and 
then turning it in a singularity container image???

Thanks again!

Kevin
