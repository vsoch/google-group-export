Yeah, I can see this being an important feature.

Essentially having a mounted directory that is "special" and writable and
always owned by the running user.

The way I work around this is by packaging my builds using EB and FPM, but
a more general solution could be very handy. I think it would be especially
handy if it was exportable in some way so that it could be transferred
separate from the main image (which would just be the OS with some
interesting deps).
