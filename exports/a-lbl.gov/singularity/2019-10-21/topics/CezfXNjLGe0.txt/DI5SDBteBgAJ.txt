Hi Igor,

I don't necessarily have a great answer for you. If seems like you are doin=
g everything right, yet it is still not working. In my case, yes nvidia-smi=
 as well as TensorFlow both work correctly. I feel like your error still ha=
s to do with the version of libcuda.so you are using. Notice how Python see=
ms to correctly load libcuda.so, yet there is later an error that is unable=
 to find libcuda.so. My first suspicion is that there is still a version mi=
smatch between the drivers installed on the image and on the host. If you a=
re sure that is not true, it may be possible that the version of the driver=
 that is installed on the machine isn't new enough for the GPU. That actual=
ly occurred on our cluster, and after a sysadmin updated the driver, it wor=
ked. Barring that I am not too sure. Maybe if you provide me with the full =
details of your installation (the versions of the packages that you have in=
stalled, the OS of your image and host), I might be able to think about som=
ething, but my suspicion is that the driver version on your host machine ma=
y not be new enough.=20

Best,
Nathan=20

or still has to do with the version of libcuda.so you are using. Notice how=
 Python seems to correctly load libcuda.so, yet there is later an error tha=
t is unable to find libcuda.so. My first suspicion is that there is still a=
 version mismatch between the drivers installed on the image and on the hos=
t. If you are sure that is not true, it may be possible that the version of=
 the driver that is installed on the machine isn't new enough for the GPU. =
That actually occurred on our cluster, and after a sysadmin updated the dri=
ver, it worked. Barring that I am not too sure. Maybe if you provide me wit=
h the full details of your installation (the versions of the packages that =
you have installed, the OS of your image and host), I might be able to thin=
k about something, but my suspicion is that the driver version on your host=
 machine may not be new enough.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><=
