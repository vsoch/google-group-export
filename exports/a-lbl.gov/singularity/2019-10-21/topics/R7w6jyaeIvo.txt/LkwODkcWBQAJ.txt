I've had some luck changing user shells in /etc/passwd to a singularity 
image, provided the image points to a shell (such as zsh) as part of the 
runscript.  The real question however, is there any way to setup things 
like bind, contain or containall to limit what the user can see on login?   
ie limit the view to only user (maybe group) processes and file system 
paths.

Ultimately this could be extended to what they can see on compute nodes as 
a kind of "cluster on demand" vs doing something with full virtualization 
(open stack, open nebula, or even k8). 


Thoughts?
