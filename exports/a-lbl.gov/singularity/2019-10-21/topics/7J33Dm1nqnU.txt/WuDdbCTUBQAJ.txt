Hi all,

In our lab, we have our home directory mounted by nfs. That means, we have 
the same home for our desktop machines and for our the cluster. The problem 
is that we use the .bashrc to export some environment variables that are 
useful when is a normal shell. But these variables might not be useful and 
produce conflicts when we are in a singularity shell or when executing an 
script through singularity (singularity exec). I would like to find a way 
to know when we are in a singularity shell so I can modify my bashrc to 
export different variables depending on the case. Is there any environment 
variable specific to singularity that I could check inside my bashrc and 
make different exports according to that variable ?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,

oriol
