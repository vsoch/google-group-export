Hi Rd,

All of the non root functionality is in the upcoming 2.3 (development
branch) and not supported in 2.2, so you are out of luck for running these
commands on your cluster as is. I would recommend taking the old school
Singularity approach - develop your image locally where you have sudo/root
and can do what you like, transfer to your cluster, and then use.

Best,

Vanessa

 a second when using a base directory, but you may quickly loose that benef=
it with dealing with parallel container execution when the container is on =
a network file system (especially a parallel file system) as metadata looku=
