I got .ova file from virtualbox that I build using ubuntu-18.04, which
include a software that I build on that environment, then I export that to
.vmdk image then used quem-img tool to get .img. Do I have to insert
.singularity.d
files to the VirtualBox image before I export it?
I have tried to mount that to my image, but nothing works. Do you think the
image's type is the problem?
Could you tell me what Kind of other images type my run on
singularity because when running this .img on singularity (error image type
not supported),please? (using mac ,singularity 2.4)
the ultimate goal is to run this singularity image in HPC .

The raw .img _should_ work I believe. I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a<br>
handler for that type of image format. But to be honest, I cannot<br>
recall if singularity can run a raw image without the<br>
`run-singularity` header that is normally inserted if we were to<br>
create one.<br>
<br>
And scratch what I said about the .singularity.d directory. You can<br>
run without ... Depending on the version you may get a warning like:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &quot;WARNING: container does not have /.singularity.d/action=

<br>
But, the /.singularity.d directory mentioned is good to have to have<br>
more consistent behave applied.<br>
<br>
So, the commands `singularity shell`, and `singularity exec` would<br>
work without the metadata directory. But, the command `singularity<br>
run` would not as that requires /.singularity.d/actions/run to exist<br>
in the image.<br>
<br>

you can do something like this (basic idea ... steps may not be quite<br>

If you are building from say 2.6.0 you don&#39;t need to create that empty<=
