</div>
<div>If it&#39;s a nipype image, I&#39;m guessing they have installed thing=
s to /root. I&#39;m not sure why this convention was used, but root is sudo=
&#39;s home, and so it makes sense you (as a user) can&#39;t poke around th=
ere. I can&#39;t be sure about all the specific weirdness
 that happens with this setting, but it&#39;s probably just best to avoid. =
If you want to play around with nipype, maybe start with their dockerfile</=
