I'm trying to set up a scenario with each application process has its own 
dedicated license server. 
If I'm understanding the documentation correctly, a given container can be 
started *either *as an instance or simply run, so I'd have one container 
invocation with the daemon and another invocation running the user process, 
which isn't exaclty what I"m looking for.
