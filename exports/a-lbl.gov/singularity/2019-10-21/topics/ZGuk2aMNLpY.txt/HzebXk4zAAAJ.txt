I run some Windows games under Linux using singularity containers and can 
really recommend it for that. 
I install and configure custom versions of wine inside the container to 
make them run flawlessly.
I have tried to do that using different approaches like
 - several wine config dirs
 - playonlinux
 - VirtualBox
but this is what I will stick to.
Besides I am notoriously running low on disk space: just compress some 
infrequently used games with bzip2 and enjoy 'df -h' :)
