BTW, I forgot to mention... the strace error message you saw about not
being able to escalate privileges actually originated by your call to
strace itself. You can not strace a program that escalates privileges, so
you would have to use the internal Singularity strace mechanism.

To reiterate:

$ strace singularity run container-name -- Will always fail
$ singularity strace container-name -- Will work if DebugOS has not been
disabled in the SPEC.

Hope that helps!
