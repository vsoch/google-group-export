ok, no latest then! It makes me question using it for singularity images,
but arguably for production stuffs people will specify a particular
version/label.

Huge +1! If you haven't tried already, do singularity inspect --json
container.img, it will spit out the container's stuffs in json format (for
future webby and other integrations)

I can definitely see useful fields in there for runtime, inputs outputs,
etc. Speaking of! I want to distinguish this internal organization
structure from (the many!) good ways to define a workflow for a container.
SCI-F will make it more easily to integrate into workflows, but isn't a
workflow specification per say. That's a hairball I'm not sure I want to be
the cat to have, heh.

I haven't looked at CWL for a while, but when I did when it first came out,
I really liked the idea and spirit but got lost really easily. It was too
much to figure out and remember and I largely gave up.

to see one version per container, but perhaps there is a reasonable way to =
support some kind of tag or version for the same software? It&#39;s not unh=
eard of that someone might want more than one. The first way is rather simp=
le and dumb, just name different folders:<div><br></div><div>/apps/fancynam=
e-1.0</div><div>/apps/fancyname-2.0</div><div><br></div><div>in the same wa=
y a tag for ubuntu:14.04 generates a singularity image named ubuntu-14.04 w=
e squash the version into one string. The next option would be to have some=
thing similar to modules, but then the apps runscript (still) loads some us=
er preference:</div><div><br></div><div>/apps/fancyname/1.0</div><div>/apps=
/fancyname/2.0<br></div><div><br></div><div>and then like you said, link th=
e runscript in the base folder of apps/fancyname to one of those versions. =
The question I want to know then, is how to install software without tellin=
g singularity some version? We could either make the version required and e=
nforce the second of the above two, or we could do what is done with unspec=
ified tags, and call it latest.</div><div><br></div><div>/apps/fancyname/la=

knows if it&#39;s latest?</div><div><br></div><div>I think what we could do=
 is encourage some standard way of specifying version in the folder organiz=
ation as a best practice (but not required or essential) and then leave it =
up to the user to determine logic. Arguably, we don&#39;t really care about=
 what kind of structure the user provides in the apps folder (it&#39;s dete=
rmined by the %appinstall foo section) as long as the %apprun section execu=
tes something relative to the top folder. That execution thing could either=
 be calling one directly, or some other logic to determine which one is cal=

ed labels?</div><div><br></div><div>* +1 fancyname! But what will it do ?</=
