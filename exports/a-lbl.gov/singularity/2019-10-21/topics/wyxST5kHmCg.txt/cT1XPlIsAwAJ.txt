Dear Vanessa,

I put a minimal working example together in 
https://github.com/kkmann/jupyter-singularity-demo. Would be glad to here 
your opinion / incorporate further improvements.

Thanks again for your help - mich appreciated!

Best wishes,

Kevin

<div>Hi Kevin,<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 &gt; the build process (singularity build ...) IS completely isolate=
d<br>
=C2=A0 Sort of... We mount /tmp during the %post section. But IIRC, that is=
 it.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 One thing you may be able to do is use a sandbox image. So, you<br>
could do something like:<br>
<br>
--- start cut ---<br>
sudo singularity build --sandbox singularity-container-image<br>
singularity-container-image.<wbr>def<br>
sudo singularity shell --writable singularity-container-image/<br>
=C2=A0 [ setup your container in the shell ]<br>
sudo singularity build singularity-container-image.<wbr>sif<br>
singularity-container-image/<br>
--- end cut<br>
<br>
So, you create a sandbox (directory) image that can be writable. Do<br>
whatever setup you need, and then make the read-only SIF image. If<br>
your issue is just that the files from your $HOME are overwriting the<br>
global config, you can run with the `--no-home` option. This will not<br>
mount your home, but it will mount your working directory still ... so<br>
if your working directory is in your HOME, that gets mounted, even<br>
though the reset of your HOME does not.<br>
