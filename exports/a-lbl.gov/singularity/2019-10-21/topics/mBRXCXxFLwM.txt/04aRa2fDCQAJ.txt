Subject: Re: [Singularity] Failed to obtain user identity information (as
 non-root user)

Hi Robert,

  > I copied output from getent for my passwd entry, pasted that into
the local /etc/passwd file on my head node

  Yes, I would expect that to work cutting out the LDAP lookup. What's
happening is that our call to `getpwuid()` is failing. This is the
issue with both the "Home directory not owned by calling user: /" and
"Failed to obtain user identity information" messages. In the former,
the lookup fails to get your home directory so it defaults to '/' ...
which of course you don't own. The `--home` option overrides what
would be obtained here.

  On the second error, it's when it's trying to write out the passwd
entry into the container /etc/passwd, and it's failing figuring out
who you are.
