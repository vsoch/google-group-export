Hi Carlos,

This is fantastic! The answer to your question depends on your use case.
For example, if I want to publish a paper and package everything nicely
into one container, given that the size is reasonable, I would share one
container with multiple entry points. If you are developing general
software for lab, then you might do better to opt for modularity and make
separate containers.

If the first is your use case (making one container) you then run into the
issue of containers just having one entry point, so if another user were to
discover your container and know nothing about it, it would be hard to
discover your special executables without some other knowledge. For this
you would want to have "internal" modularity and discoverability, and this
is possible with something called the Scientific Filesystem (SCIF). As luck
would have it, I have several examples for using SCIF with genomics
applications!

    https://sci-f.github.io/apps/examples/carrierseq.scif
    https://sci-f.github.io/apps/examples/snakemake.scif
    https://sci-f.github.io/apps/examples/scientific

If you are interested, I can help to work with you to develop such a
container! When you install SCIF apps in a Singularity container, if you
build it on Singularity Hub they are automatically found. Let me know !

Best,

Vanessa
