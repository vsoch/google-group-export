Hi Greg,

Thanks for getting back to me with that. 

That does sound right, and I'm pretty sure Docker in my production env 
isn't setting privileged, while journalctl is recording the launch with 
privileged=false.

However, unless I'm missing something, the Docker in my VM test environment 
(where singularity works) doesn't explicitly use the --privileged option 
and from journalctl it also looks like privileged is false.

Could there be anything else that would result in similar behaviour? Does 
anyone know if there is a way of actually testing privilege requirements 
from within a docker container?

Thanks,

Chris
