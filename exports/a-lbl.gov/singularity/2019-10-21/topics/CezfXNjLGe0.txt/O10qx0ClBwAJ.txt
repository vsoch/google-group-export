Hi Igor,

  That I don't know. That run file is from the cuda installer, so I
would hope it supported the Tesla cards. I have installed both the
cuda-7.0 and cuda-7.5 side by side. The 7.5 was installed second since
it was wanted to be default. But I haven't ran into any issues with
the driver not supporting a card unless it was a really old card...
