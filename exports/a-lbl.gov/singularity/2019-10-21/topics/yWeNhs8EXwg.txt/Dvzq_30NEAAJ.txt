Subject: privileges inside the singularity namespace

Hi brains trust,
There are a couple of things I would like to do with singularity but they
run up against some completely sensible restrictions on privileges, and I'm
looking for a way forward. I'm not adverse to cutting some code and making
a PR (although my C might be a little rusty) but I'd really like some
feedback before I consider writing any code.

One thing I would really like to do is to put a vncserver and window
manager in a container. Infact we've done this. It works OK, but there are
a couple of extra things we would like to do to make it work really well.

The first thing I would like to do is run Xorg in conjunction with a
singularity container. At the moment we start Xorg on the host before
executing the container. We then use vglrun over a TCP connection to
connect to redirect all the OpenGL calls to the Xorg process. There are a
number of ways I can think of ti skin this particular cat. One is do
nothing (host based Xorg and TCP connections is good enough). Another to to
maybe mount the Xorg domain sockets into the singularity namespace to cut
out the TCP component. A third, perhaps I could bind mount the SUID Xorg
binary into the singularity container if I added some exception in the
global config file allowing SUID binaries to remain SUID.

The second thing I would like to do is execute "singularity inside
singularity". In particular, having started a window manager and vncserver
from a singularity container, I'd really like to start another singularity
container with a different application in it. Again I have a couple of
thoughts around this:

If using singularity with SUID bits, I could perhaps allow the hosts copy
of singularity to bind mount into the container namespace without dropping
that SUID bit by an extension to the config.

I could leverage SSH and X forwarding to ssh back to the local host and
start singularity a second time from the host OS again over a TCP
connection. This would have the disadvantage that it might escape my slurm
c group (I might to have install the pam_slurm_adopt plugin ... we're not
using it currently). Also the disadvantage of added TCP latency

I could look closely at the way the privileges work and see if there is any
tricks I can pull there.

Hoping somebody has some clever ideas.
Cheers,
--
Chris
