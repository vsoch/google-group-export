Oliver, thanks for your response.  Yes, that's a valid question we have 
been asking the users about this application and the needs for root access 
via sudo.  The problem is there is embedded on the code a "sudo do_this" 
call initially it can't be removed (hard-coded).  From a system perspective 
the call has a kind of easy solution as this is related to data access we 
can deal with UNIX permissions - here we need to fix errors made on the 
past - but the problem is the dependency of this legacy software for the 
entire workflow they are using to run Monte Carlo simulations and the 
hard-coded sudo entry.

Your workaround could be feasible combined with the UNIX permission fix we 
should do for data access.  I will let you know how it goes.

As you noticed, the subject itself gives me the answer for my question 
about user privileges escalation, we are aware about it, we desire this to 
have the singularity containers isolated to be owned by the specific user 
launching the container.  This is just an unexpected situation we are 
trying to handle.

VR,
-Hugo
