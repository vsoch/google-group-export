is there a different way to do have cuda9 and cudnn7 inside the container?

Does anything stand out? Would really appreciate your help as always!

Interesting, so this is definitely something to do with the Singularity bui=

You can (after your modifications) test this, push to docker hub, and then =

hey, it gets the job done.

Have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30316812/ubuntu-apt-get-=

Consider the suggestion to add the google nameservers  (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4<htt=
p://8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4>) to /etc/resolve.conf which fixed installing git for m=
e, without editing the urls in sources.list


II) you may want an " export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=3Dnoninteractive" in the post =
section to try to pass the pop up menus if you want to go on with building.=
  You could consider setting up locale info early in %post section


III) if you want interactive you can consider building a --sandbox, stoppin=
g at a good point, and then sudo singularity shell --writable into the sand=
box to continue in a shell

Rutu,

There shouldn't be any dialog box that pops up when building the container =
from the definition file. Are you using a Linux virtual machine (e.g., runn=

Not a specific one, but if you search for the label that is the cuda versio=
n, there are a ton!

https://singularity-hub.org/labels/com.nvidia.cuda.version

A control F finds 30 with tensorflow, so maybe one of those guys will be go=

It looks like you are pointing at a non-existent repository or mirror for t=
he software.  The error reports that the files are not at
the URL you are pointing at.

I am not a ubuntu person but rather centos but you should be able to point =
at another ubuntu repository site.

<br>
II) you may want an &quot; export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=3D<wbr>noninteractive&quo=
t; in the post section to try to pass the pop up menus if you want to go on=
 with building.&nbsp; You could consider setting up locale info early in %p=
ost section&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>
III) if you want interactive you can consider building a --sandbox, stoppin=
g at a good point, and then sudo singularity shell --writable into the sand=
box to continue in a shell

Hi Marty,<br>
<br>
Yes I am using Vagrant. Attached is the screen. I can't tab or use up and d=
own arrow keyes or anything else to get to OK to continue the process.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

There shouldn't be any dialog box that pops up when building the container =
from the definition file.&nbsp;Are you using a Linux virtual machine (e.g.,=
 running on Virtual Box) to use Singularity? Maybe you can send us some scr=
eenshots showing the issue?<br>

Hi Marty, I actually tried that first - but in the process a dialogue box c=
omes that requires me to click/select &quot;OK&quot;, but they keyes on my =
keyboard are not mapped to the display it seems and I am not able to procee=
d from here.
<br>
<br>
I tried a few other recipes as well from Singularity Hub, haven't yet been =
able to successfully build a container that has Tensorflow 1.12.0, cuda 9 a=
nd cudnn 7 and has also has git. :(<br>
<br>

And as I mentioned previously, if you need to build a custom container for =
your work, have a look at our definition file [1]. We build TensorFlow with=
 GPU support from source for both python2 and python3.&nbsp;<br>

Not a specific one, but if you search for the label that is the cuda versio=
n, there are a ton!

A control F finds 30 with tensorflow, so maybe one of those guys will be go=

It looks like you are pointing at a non-existent repository or mirror for t=
he software.&nbsp; The error reports that the files are not at
<br>
the URL you are pointing at.<br>
<br>
I am not a ubuntu person but rather centos but you should be able to point =
at another ubuntu repository site.<br>

I'm not sure - I'd guess it's the latest in development (1.13.1 something) =
so you could try installing the version you need:
<br>
<br>
pip install tensorflow=3D=3D1.12.0<br>
