Hi, 

my %runscript starts 3 server processes as daemons 

1. http localhost:3002
2. mongod localhost:27017
3. node.js app localhost:3000

The last application that is launched is node. When I terminate node, 
singularity quits.
But I still have processes with open ports on my host system, because I did 
not quit
them properly from inside the container. Is there a good way of doing this 
kind of things?
Would it be possible to use some kind of init process like the one used in 
docker?
https://github.com/krallin/tini
But that wouldn't work for multiple daemons, or?
Or is the best way of doing it, to shell into the container and start and 
stop everything manually?
Any ideas?

Thanks,

Till
