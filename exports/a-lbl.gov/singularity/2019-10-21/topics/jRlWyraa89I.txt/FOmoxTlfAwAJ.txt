Hi,

This is probably related to permissions on the directory above zdiff 
(/usr/bin inside the container). We have fixes coming in version 2.5 that 
should address this issue that happens with some docker containers where 
layer files contain very restricted permissions, or the build is run under 
a restrictive umask.

If you would like to try before 2.5 is released, all of the relevant fixes 
are now in the development-2.x branch on github. I'm afraid the 2.5-rc1 
release tarball on the GitHub releases page may not include what's required 
for this issue.
