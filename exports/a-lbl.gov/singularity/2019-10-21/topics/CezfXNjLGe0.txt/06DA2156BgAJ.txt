unable to find libcuda.so. My first suspicion is that there is still a vers=

 you are sure that is not true, it may be possible that the version of the =
driver that is installed on the machine isn't new enough for the GPU. That =
actually occurred on our cluster, and after a sysadmin updated the driver, =
it worked. Barring that I am not too sure. Maybe if you provide me with the=
 full details of your installation (the versions of the packages that you h=
ave installed, the OS of your image and host), I might be able to think abo=
ut something, but my suspicion is that the driver version on your host mach=

 error still has to do with the version of libcuda.so you are using. Notice=
 how Python seems to correctly load libcuda.so, yet there is later an error=
 that is unable to find libcuda.so. My first suspicion is that there is sti=
ll a version mismatch between the drivers installed on the image and on the=
 host. If you are sure that is not true, it may be possible that the versio=
n of the driver that is installed on the machine isn't new enough for the G=
PU. That actually occurred on our cluster, and after a sysadmin updated the=
 driver, it worked. Barring that I am not too sure. Maybe if you provide me=
 with the full details of your installation (the versions of the packages t=
hat you have installed, the OS of your image and host), I might be able to =
think about something, but my suspicion is that the driver version on your =
host machine may not be new enough.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Best,</d=
