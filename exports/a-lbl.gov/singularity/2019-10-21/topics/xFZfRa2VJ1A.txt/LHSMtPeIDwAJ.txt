Hi Thomas,

Let's say I write a shell script that calls gimp and then firefox (for some 
crazy reason).  My version 1 of the image would contain my script, gimp, as 
well as firefox.  I then want to modify my script.  I will need to create a 
new image which contains all three even though only a few bytes of my 
script have changed.  Unfortunately as limitation is that I can't allow 
download from singularity hub, etc...I need to provide all files, even 
third party.

I'm really trying to capture a flow.  I have a messy collection of python 
scripts, shell scripts, in-house tools, 3rd party tools.  I want to bundle 
that up to make deployment a lot easier.

Robert
