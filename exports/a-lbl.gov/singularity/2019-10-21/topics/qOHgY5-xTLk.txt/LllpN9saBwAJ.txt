I am looking for a way to run singularity container like environment on
systems where sysadmins are resisting installing singularity. In particular
I need to run some deep learning code on OpenScience Grid and as far as I
heard not all sites with GPUs there have singularity.

How do I do it? Do I just build singularity and install it on a user
account? Would --nv GPU feature work?

How can I find out if the kernel has such a support?

The main feature I would hate to lose is --nv. Unpacking different versions
of NVIDIA drivers into container the old way is so annoying...

Wow! With this, what is the advantage or disadvantage of containers? Will
Gentoo installed on a user account under Linux be able to use GPU? OpenMP?
MPI? Must one install NVIDIA drivers inside Prefix or it can use the ones
from the host? Is Gentoo installed on one Linux portable to another linux
by rsync or one has to install it from scratch on each system?

Thank you,
Igor
