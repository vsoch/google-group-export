Hiya!

Locking is only necessary for container caching (not running). For example,
when you run ./container.sapp for the first time (or "singularity
run/install container.sapp), it must cache the contents of the container to
disk. If you do something like "./container.sapp &; ./container.sapp &;
wait;" (or launch via an mpirun that is not Singularity aware*), you will
run into a condition where multiple processes are trying to cache the
container contents and thus a race condition. The locking ensures whichever
Singularity process obtains an install lock, will do the caching and any
other containers that do not achieve the lock will be blocked until the
lock is freed.

*note: Open MPI pre-release 2.1 *is* Singularity aware, and does the
installation in a scalable manner for large scale parallel execution.

Hopefully that helps to clear things up.

Greg
