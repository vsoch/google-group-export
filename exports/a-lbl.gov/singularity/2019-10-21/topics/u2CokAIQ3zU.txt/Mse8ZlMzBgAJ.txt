Yes, I think you're absolutely right. /home works because it's already in
the image whereas /panfs/pfs.local (the realm) doesn't because it's not
already in the image. So far I haven't had much luck with bind but I'm
working on that. Since I downloaded this particular image from a repository
that hosts biology specific images for one of our users I'm not really sure
about modifying it. The Singularity docs say something about using
--writable but I haven't found a permutation of commands that recognizes
--writable as a real thing and the docs don't give any examples of where or
how it's actually supposed to be used (or more likely I haven't found the
right page yet).

Yes I've discovered overlay doesn't exist in our kernel and feel foolish
for not realizing that earlier, although I think it would probably solve my
problem, upgrading to RHEL 7 isn't on the roadmap until next year.
