This will be an interesting and pretty easy configuration option to allow
what kind of images to allow in the config(squashfs, ext, or
directory/sandbox images). Actually I think we only really need to be
worries about writable ext3 based containers.

We are locking the development branch of Singularity soon so I will try to
get that option in there before the feature freeze.

Thanks!
