Hi Greg:

Sorry I forgot to paste...  this is the issue I was trying to solve:

bernardl@ubuntu:~$ sudo /opt/singularity/bin/singularity bootstrap
sl7.img scientific.def.orig

[sudo] password for bernardl:

./scientific.def.orig: line 3: $1: unbound variable

This was on Ubuntu LTS 16.04.1.

Thanks,

Bernard
