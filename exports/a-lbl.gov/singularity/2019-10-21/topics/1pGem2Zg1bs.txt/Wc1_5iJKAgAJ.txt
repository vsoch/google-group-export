With the newly released version 3.2.0 I am seeing this warning when I run 
any container:

$ singularity shell container.sif
WARNING: seccomp requested but not enabled, seccomp library is missing or 
too old

This is the same as https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/3418 but 
the reason why I am posting this here is to understand how seccomp is being 
or not being used in the Singularity build process. 

Is there a setting to request/force/disable the seccomp? Do we want to use 
seccomp?

I have to admit that the Go based build still feels to me like a black box, 
as compared to the configuration options with autoconf or cmake.

Thanks,
MC
