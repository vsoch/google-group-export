For the docker integration there are plenty of heuristics worth porting to
singularity here:
https://github.com/chrisfilo/docker2singularity/blob/master/docker2singularity.sh
One big difference from current docker import is that it uses "docker
inspect" to gather metadata (such as ENV and ENTRYPOINT) that are not
present in the exported tarball.

One thing I found challenging is trying to figure out the size of the
container across different docker versions. The "docker inspect
--format="{{.Size}}" only works in recent docker versions (that's why
docker2singularity does not work on travis unless you upgrade docker
version).

I hope this helps!

Best,
Chris
