Hi, I'm struggling to mount a volume inside a container using programs 
which utilize fuse (sshfs, s3ql). My container will need to run on shared 
hpc resources, so having root permissions is not feasible. On my 
workstation (without using singularity), these mount operations do not 
require elevated permissions.

For example:

$ singularity shell --writable sing.img
Singularity sing.img:~/Desktop> sshfs <remotehost> <mountpoint>

fusermount: mount failed: Operation not permitted


Running the singularity shell with sudo makes everything work just fine. 
Any suggestions? Our group uses s3ql to provide transparent deduplication 
and compression independent of the storage backend, and if we can't mount 
inside a container then I don't think our group will be able to use 
containers.
