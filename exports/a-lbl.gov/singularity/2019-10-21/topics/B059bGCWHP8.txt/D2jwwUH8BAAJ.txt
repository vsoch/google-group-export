Subject: Re: Community Feedback: Sylabs Builder API as Singularity Registry Endpoint

Oh! And it would be totally trivial and easy to also add the Builder as an
option to the Global Client, which akin to the other endpoints
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/clients> would let you
manage interaction with containers in your local $HOME to ensure that they
are organized and can be found later. For a quick reminder:

 - Singularity Registry server is a complete Dockerized application
appropriate for an institution to deploy, adding the Sylabs Builder API
would mean an integration to issue a build command from it, and have an
image built for it (for a large group of users), accessible with an shub://
uri.
 - Singularity Registry Global Client is appropriate for the single user to
be able to manage and interact with their own little container collection,
and it could have that same builder endpoint.

T'would be super cool in either case :)

Best,

Vanessa
