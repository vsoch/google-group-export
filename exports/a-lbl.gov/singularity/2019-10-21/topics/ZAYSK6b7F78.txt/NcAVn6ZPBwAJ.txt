Good morning, 

I am having an issue while attempting to run a container image on my 
universities HPC, either via a qsub script or via terminal. 
When attempting to shell into the container or run via the qsub script I 
receive the following error: 

~/container> singularity shell MFiX_v1.simg
ERROR  : Could not create /dev/loop0: Permission denied
ABORT  : Retval = 255

I am fairly new to linux and am not too sure where to begin in solving this 
error. As is typical on most HPC systems I do not have root access on the 
HPC and can only run as a user. 
I built the container on a linux virtual machine where I have root 
privileges and have had no issues running the above command as a user on my 
virtual machine. 

The container has been built on Ubuntu 16.04 as the base operating system 
and the host environment is running on Ubuntu 18.04

The university HPC is running on the SUSE Linux Operating System. 

Any advice as to the cause and possible remedy of this error is greatly 
appreciated. 

Regards, 
S. Rees
