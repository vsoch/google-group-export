Hello there,

 my name is Steven, and I am evaluating singularity in the context of the 
academic project "Citing&Archiving Research" (Citar).
It's a federal project and amongst us (Ulm University, Germany) as of now 
two other HPC computing centres are involved.
So far I succeeded in building and running the HPC example with OpenMPI 
trunk, and I was able to get gromacs working multi-node in singularity 
containers on our HPC cluster JUSTUS.

I'm glad I have found singularity it seems to meet our requirements better 
than docker - and would be glad to gather some more knowledge about it here.

Now a few questions to you: 

-Does anyone of you use singularity for migration or archiving purposes 
already?
-Is trunk OpenMPI really a requirement or can I use older versions, too? 
What about IMPI?
-Can singularity be installed/run from inside docker containers?

that's for now,
thanks and bye Steven
