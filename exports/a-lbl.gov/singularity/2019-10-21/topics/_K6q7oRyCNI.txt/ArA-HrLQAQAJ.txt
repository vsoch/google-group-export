Hi Vanessa,

Containers FTW sounds really interesting, I'll have a look.

The github repo you found was the correct one. I didn't want to build 
the main branch, so I didn't put a Singularity file there. In our 
competition, we have multiple tracks and the plan was that participants 
use tags or branches to identify which revision of their repository 
should run in which track. In the demo repository, I added one such 
branch ("demo-ipc-submission") and enabled it in Singularity Hub. Do I 
also need a Singularity file in the master branch (even if I don't want 
to build that image)?

Anyway, the reason I stopped looking in this direction was not the 
failed build. Mercurial support and the additional tests are much more 
critical for us. Should I add a feature request for that on the issues 
board?

If you are interested in the scripts I planned to use, I can give you 
access but I wouldn't want to make them public just now.

I've never used vagrant but from the looks of it I could just download 
your VM, ssh into it, clone my scripts and run them as root (which will 
clone the participants' repositories and bootstrap them). Is that the 
way to go?

Cheers,
Florian
