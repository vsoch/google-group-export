Hello,

If I understood correct, modification of the OS filesystem of container 
always needs to be done by a privileged user, be it root or by means of 
sudo.

What I realized was that when I launched singularity with sudo, then my 
actual $HOME (/home/$USER) was not bind mounted but rather /root was 
mounted. Is this the expected behavior? Since one usually saves data in 
/home/$USER, in order to retrieve the data there, one needs to manually 
bind her own home with the -B flag, which is cumbersome and 
counter-intuitive.  ( -H /home/<user> did not work. I got "Home directory 
ownership incorrect: /home/<user>). Is that also a problem for you?

Furthermore, on my workstation /home is an NFS share  (I think this is 
pretty usual, isn't it?) When I am granted sudo right and am allowed to 
launch singularity with sudo to bind-mount my home with the -B option, I 
also found myself able to bind-mount any user's home with the -B option. 
Since I am elevated to root inside the container, I can destroy any data 
(of my colleagues) in the NFS share. Is this a known issue or did I make 
something wrong?
