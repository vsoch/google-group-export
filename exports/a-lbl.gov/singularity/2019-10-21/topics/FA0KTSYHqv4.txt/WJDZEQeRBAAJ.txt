You might want to run this by your legal folks there at LANL as the LBNL li=
censing language has been accepted and used there for a long time (even pre=
dating my time there). I=E2=80=99m sure Greg isn't qualified to answer your=
 concerns (nor does anyone on this mailing list have the requisite legal tr=
aining to do so) ,and certainly he cannot comment on nor modify things that=
 the lawyers wrote and UC approved.

That=E2=80=99s what lawyers are for - we should let them do their job :-)
