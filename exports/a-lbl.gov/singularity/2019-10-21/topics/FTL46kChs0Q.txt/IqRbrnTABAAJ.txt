It appears that invoking the shell as root and writable, one can add
add an entry to the container's password and group files and then use
'/bin/su -' to assume the id of the requested person.

$ sudo singularity shell --writable -B /home centos6.img
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity.centos6.img> echo 'grundoon:x:109447:65540:Evil
Twin:/home/grundoon:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd

Singularity.centos6.img> echo "mystaff:x:65540:" >> /etc/group

Singularity.centos6.img> /bin/su - grundoon
[grundoon@flux-build ~]$ id
uid=109447(grundoon) gid=65540(mystaff) groups=65540(mystaff)

[grundoon@flux-build ~]$ id
uid=109447(grundoon) gid=65540(hpcstaff) groups=65540(hpcstaff)

[grundoon@flux-build ~]$ whoami
grundoon

[grundoon@flux-build ~]$ pwd
/home/grundoon

[grundoon@flux-build ~]$ ls
Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh  miniconda2                 sasuser.v93

If the container is opened writable by root, who then creates
/usr/local/grundoon and chowns that to grundoon, but grundoon owns the
container, grundoon can do this:

[grundoon@flux-build tmp]$ singularity shell --writable centos6.img
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity.centos6.img> cd /usr/local/grundoon

Singularity.centos6.img> touch I_AM_GROOT

Singularity.centos6.img> ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 grundoon mystaff 0 Mar 17 18:18 I_AM_GROOT

Whether that is a sane thing to do, well, that is an exercise left to
the reader.
