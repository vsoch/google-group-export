Hi, 

I am sure this has been discussed in this forum.

I have a container that I have setup as 'root' . Now when I go about using 
that container to get (even) a 'shell' off the container, I get the error 
below:

./singularity shell /tmp/singularity_containers/debian_latest.img           
               
ERROR  : Singularity is not running with appropriate privileges!
ERROR  : Check installation path is not mounted with 'nosuid', and/or 
consult manual.
ABORT  : Retval = 255

How do I fix this so, I can install containers as a 'root' user but still 
be able to run -  'exec' , 'run', 'shell' commands as a regular user?

Thanks for your help!
