Based on your example, is it correct to say that a metalink is really just
akin to an XML endpoint for a container, with the URI to return the data
structure being the unique identifier? What would be the difference if,
say, we returned json instead of xml?

At least for Singularity Hub, we already have a JSON version of this, and I
also calculate a file hash when it's generated, so it would be fairly
simple to also provide an XML endpoint to deliver the same, if this would
plug into more applications that use XML (cough, Java?,cough?) hehe. Would
that be useful to you?
