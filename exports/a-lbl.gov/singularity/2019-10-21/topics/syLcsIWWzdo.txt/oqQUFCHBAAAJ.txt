I'll chime in at how I've done this...

Our environment uses environment modules and univa grid engine (uge). I 
simply bind the installation directory and the directory containing the 
module file. From within the container, as long as I've sourced 
/etc/profile I can module load our cluster setup module and start using 
qsub inside the container from the host without any issue.

The main point isn't necessarily to run qsub manually from within the 
container, many workflows have built libraries assuming qsub is available 
or DRMAA libraries are present with the correct configs. Running qsub 
outside the container would break these kinds of workflows and wouldn't 
make sense.
