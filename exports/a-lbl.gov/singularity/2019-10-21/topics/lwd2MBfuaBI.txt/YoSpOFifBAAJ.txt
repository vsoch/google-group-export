Hello,
I am experiencing problems with running a container built using --sandbox 
option.
The context is that I am facing a rather complicated build for a software 
package which has many not-so-well documented dependencies - so I would 
like to try it out interactively before writing a recipe.

I am on a cluster where I don't have sudo permissions and singularity 
version is:
2.6.1-dist 

I build the image like this:
 singularity build --sandbox beam_try.img  
docker://triumfmlutils/beam_rl:initial1

There are few warnings during the build:
WARNING: Building sandbox as non-root may result in wrong file permissions
WARNING: Warning reading tar header: Ignoring malformed pax extended 
attribute 
WARNING: Building container as an unprivileged user. If you run this 
container as root
WARNING: it may be missing some functionality.

When trying to run the container I get an error:
$ singularity exec beam_try.simg /bin/bash
ERROR  : Could not mount Singularity overlay: Invalid argument
ABORT  : Retval = 255

Sorry if this is obvious - I am somewhat new to singularity, but googling 
around didn't get me anywhere...

Any hints on how to make this work appreciated...
