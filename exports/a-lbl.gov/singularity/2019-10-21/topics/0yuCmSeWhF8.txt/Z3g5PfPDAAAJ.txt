Hi everyone!

It is with immense pleasure that I introduce everyone to Sylabs Inc.

Over the last few years, Singularity has gone from a simple idea to massive
adoption within the HPC and scientific world. This is because Singularity
filled a niche -- and this niche continues to grow considerably. With
growth comes need and thus opportunity!

To that point, I founded Sylabs Inc. I envision the company's role as
two-fold: to work with organizations that need additional help and to take
the development efforts of Singularity to the next level. So far, we have
engaged and partnered with several organizations (more announcements on
that front coming soon). We've also taken the opportunity to start staffing
the initial development team who will be bringing even more features and
functionality to Singularity.

It is also important to note that Sylabs is committed to open source. I
have personally been involved in the open source community since the
mid-late 90's and have founded several highly successful open source
projects (like CentOS Linux and Warewulf). I've seen firsthand what can be
accomplished when companies collaborate with open source communities to
create effective and mutually beneficial business models. Here's my pledge
to you: the Sylabs' business model will completely support the open source
development model. In fact, our focus is on areas that bring additional
value above anything we have done yet (e.g. long term life cycles for
releases, signed binary package releases via subscription access, a hand to
hold if you ever need additional help, etc).

And in the spirit of open source, this forum will not be used for flagrant
plugging or marketing our products. (And a big thank you to Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab for continuing to host this public forum!) So if you
are interested in what we working on, getting support for Singularity, or
inquiring about partnering with us, please check out our new website (
http://www.sylabs.io/) and feel free to contact us at: in...@sylabs.io

Warmest regards,
Greg
