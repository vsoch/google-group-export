Hi Martin,

I was surprised to learn how much you can nowadays make run under wine if
you're just willing to put some effort into it.
My guess is that you need is someone with wine/windows expertise and bring
them together with the people familiar to HPC/singularity.
Seems like fun to me :) but probably not worth the while.
If you want a quick&lazy solution a KVM with windows/reactos is what you
could try
