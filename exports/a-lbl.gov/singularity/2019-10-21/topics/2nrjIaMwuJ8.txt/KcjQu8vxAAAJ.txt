I have no experience (yet) running Singularity on GPU nodes but I will 
mention that NIH has embraced Singularity and they have some very good 
documentation here:
https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/singularity.html

See specifically the section "Singularity on GPU nodes."  They also have 
some sample def files that might be helpful.
