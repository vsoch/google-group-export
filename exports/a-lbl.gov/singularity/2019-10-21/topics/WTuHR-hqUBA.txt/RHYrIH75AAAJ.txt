Hi John,

I think you are referring to our OMPI Git master build container recipe
found in the development tree at:
`examples/legacy/2.2/contrib/centos7-ompi_master.def`.

In general I whole-heartily agree with your perspectives and I should
mention, I only did that because there was no released stable version of
OMPI available that supported Singularity, and I never went back to fix
that example as I figured it might be useful for someone to see an example
of how to pull from GitHub.

BTW, the last webservers I ran, I did not build it myself,... but I don't
think I've ever run a distributions version of OMPI. Hrmmm, but now that I
think of it, I have run a distribution's OFED stack! Oh, what a tangled
mess. hah

Thanks,
Greg
