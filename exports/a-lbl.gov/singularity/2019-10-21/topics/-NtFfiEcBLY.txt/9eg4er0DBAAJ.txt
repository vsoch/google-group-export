Hi Greg,

First, we would like to thank you for leading this effort and making this a 
reality for scientific computing ! We think Singularity will give us what 
we have long desired (an immutable installation and reproducible runtime 
environment) for our scientific tool collection no matter which host our 
job lands for execution or infrastructural updates applied to the 
underlying host, barring any major kernel updates.

We, at Pfizer, are piloting a use case wherein container-to-container 
invocation is desired in an HPC environment.  To give you some background 
on our setup, we installed a set of our tools comprising R, Nonmem and PsN 
into a single container. Our cluster manager is IBM/LSF (previously from 
Platform computing).   We use "R" for plots and reporting via R markdown 
and Latex.  We use Nonmem (NONlinear Mixed Effect Modeling) for modeling 
and simulation and PsN (a collection of perl modules) that spin up a number 
of NONMEM jobs in parallel.  In this use case, a user submits a PsN LSF job 
on the first node, which then submits several child LSF jobs, each running 
a Nonmem instance.  At the completion of all the Nonmem jobs, PsN collects 
and summarizes the results via "R" plots and graphs.

At the moment, we are able to execute such a job by re-initializing (env 
-i) the child job submission environment.  But before we finalize an 
approach, we want to understand if there is a different mechanism to 
achieve the same within Singularity.  Also, we want to ensure any future 
plans that may be on the table will NOT impede our implementation model.  
Would very much appreciate your thoughts and comments on our approach.

Many thanks,

-Vijay
