Subject: SUG CFP Deadline Extended [was Re: [Singularity] Singularity User
 Group (SUG) Website Live, CFP and Registration Open!]
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="0000000000003c598c05811c43b1"

We've already received some excellent proposals for talks at SUG.

However, we knew the original submission deadline of February 5 might be a
little too soon for some ... so, we've *extended* it to *February 15*!

We really hope that those of you here who are responsible for making
Singularity what is today will also take the time to consider sharing your
contributions, use cases, experiences, requirements, etc., with your peers
and the broader community. Our CFP itemizes a number of topics that we
welcome submissions to consider.

All we need from you is a title and a few sentences that describe your
talk. That's it!

SUG is shaping up to be an excellent event, and we hope you'll make it even
better by being *actively* involved.

The CFP can be found at https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/sug2019/839030/
.

We look forward to hearing from you!

-Ian
