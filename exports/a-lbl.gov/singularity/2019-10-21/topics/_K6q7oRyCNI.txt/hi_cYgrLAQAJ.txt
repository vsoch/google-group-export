Subject: Re: [Singularity] Recommended way to run bootstrap on unknown repository

Hey there,

That sounds really cool.  Will the contest be open to everyone?  Can you
send a link or something?

There are ways that a user could write to your system in both the %setup
and %post section.  I would be wary of running an untrusted definition file
on a system that you cared about.  I would suggest either using a VM (on a
local machine or an AWS or GCP instance) or using Singularity Hub
<https://singularity-hub.org/> to do the builds.

Dave
