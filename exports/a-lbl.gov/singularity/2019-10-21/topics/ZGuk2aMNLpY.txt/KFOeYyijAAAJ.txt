Martin, 

 I started to have another look at running win apps using singularity, 
maybe this def file will help you or others to get going:

BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%runscript
    echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."

%post
    dpkg --add-architecture i386 
    apt update
    apt -y install wget software-properties-common 
python3-software-properties apt-transport-https
    wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/Release.key
    apt-key add Release.key
    apt-add-repository https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/
    apt update
    apt install -y winehq-stable # this installs Wine2
