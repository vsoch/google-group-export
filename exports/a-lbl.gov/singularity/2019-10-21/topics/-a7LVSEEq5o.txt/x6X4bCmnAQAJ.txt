Hi Singularity/Hub Community,

In preparation for the release of Singularity Hub 2.0, we are migrating to
a new cloud space with resources allocated just for Singularity Hub. This
means it's time for some housecleaning and organization! If you are a
collection owner, we need to know in advance the images that are essential
for you to transfer. Here are your options:

*1.*  Recommended: The simplest and fastest is to re-build your current
containers on the new
Singularity Hub. If you choose this option, then when Singularity Hub 2.0
is ready you can log in, connect repositories, and start building.

*2. *If you have need to migrate an old collection, you must do the
following:
   - specify preferences here https://goo.gl/forms/YXRuq2bbgFaFUsw13
   - when ready, log in, and re-connect all repositories.
   - the images will be generated as "frozen" (not changeable images)
associated with the collection


*And some frequently asked questions:*

*Why would I want the new image format?*
The new version 2.4 format produces smaller files that are better for
scientific reproducibility. The current Singularity Hub has to compress,
upload, and decompress your images to get them up and running. With the new
format, you can download as is. Read about the release here
<http://singularity.lbl.gov/release-2-4>.

*Why do I need to authenticate again?*
Per your request, Github authentication only asks for the absolute minimum
that it needs, namely write access to webhooks and no direct access to
code. Thus, you would need to  verify these permissions again, and create
new webhooks for your repository.

*What happens if I don't hear from you?*
Users that don't respond or indicate preference will not have any
containers migrated.

If your preference is to log in again and reconnect the same repos, you are
good to go. No
further action is needed on your part. This is the suggested route for
those that don't have
huge dependencies on pre-existing containers.

Thanks for your use and support of Singularity Hub! We will provide another
email with more
details about changes to Singularity Hub, and are excited to make the next
version available to you.

Let the robots know your preferences!
<https://goo.gl/forms/YXRuq2bbgFaFUsw13>

Best,

Vanessa
