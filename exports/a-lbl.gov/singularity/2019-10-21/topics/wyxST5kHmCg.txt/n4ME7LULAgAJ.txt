 Thanks for bearing with me ;)

So, to be absolutely clear, the build process (singularity build ...) IS 
completely isolated (not using my host user home). The problems I 
experience are due to the fact that when I execute commands via singularity 
exec, singularity by default binds my user home from the host and thus 
messes up my configs (which are stored in /home/root in the container image 
since I build with sudo).
