wow, that is fantastic!! I just grabbed one(irssi-2016-05-24.img.zip), and
after unzipping it, the img file doesn't appear to be a valid image:

$ unzip -a irssi-2016-05-24.img.zip

Ahh, the base set for diffs? Good thinking.

So something I am going to be working on (and requesting yours and
potentially other's help) is to have Singularity actually leverage Docker
behind the scenes so it can take a Dockerfile and create the Singularity
image from that. At that point, we don't need to replicate the Dockerfile
lingo and then the Singularity bootstrap definition/recipe files will be
more robust and reliable for Singularity's purpose.

Aside from having Docker running on a Singularity build host, do you see
any negatives for that?

On the other hand, there is utility in being able to convert from a
Dockerfile to a Singularity definition, so I am not discounting that idea.
Just thinking about how to reasonably do it in shell... I can easily do it
in Perl (and I'm sure others can do it in Python) but it would be nice to
not have higher level languages as a dependency. Thoughts?

Haha, "highly important" ehh? Even though I'm not a Pokemon fan, that is
cool though!

Thanks!
