Hi,

I am trying to set up MPI with Singularity. I had set up openmpi version=20
1.8.4 in the container as the host system has the same openmpi version.=20
However, the container does not understand that there are 2 compute nodes=
=20
even after specifying a hosts file. So each time I spawn the MPI processes=
=20
it just executes on a single node. The contents of the hosts file=20
is nid00900,nid00901.

~~~~~~
aprun1:~> ccmrun mpirun -np 20 --hostfile hosts singularity exec mpi.img=20
/usr/bin/ring=20

In addition, the singularity version in the host is 2.2.1
