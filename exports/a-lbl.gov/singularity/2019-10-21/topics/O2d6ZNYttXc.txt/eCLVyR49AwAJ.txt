Yes -- but there's certainly plenty of CVEs (possibly many more!)
associated with kernel bugs tickled by normal, unprivileged arbitrary
user space code.

That's why I think the more pertinent question is:
- Whether the resource owner views this as a new significant risk
(particularly, if you already allow the user to submit jobs in a batch
system, have access to Infiniband, shared FS, etc).
- Whether the risk outweighs the benefits.

Certainly our local site has made one decision - and I understand and
respect that other sites may come to different conclusions.  That's OK
too!  To over-generalize -- if all open-science research computing
centers had to take the same security posture as the NSA, not much
science would be done!

I think the important aspect is the resource owner considers these
sorts of factors in the context of what they already allow the user to
do.

(FWIW - there's a few other *excellent* LWN articles over the last 1-2
years on the topic; short on time right now, so I don't have a link
handy...)

I don't see arbitrary FS images in user+mount namespaces in the
near-future.  I *hope* that we will be able to see FUSE filesystems in
user+mount namespaces in the next year or two.  After all - the Linux
devs have to consider a much broader range of use cases than I do!

The alternate approach (disable images, force users to unpack) does
help reduce the overall risk profile.  Additionally, locally we're
quite pleased with the potential of user namespaces -- I always tell
folks that if your sysadmin isn't paranoid about adding a new setuid
binary, you need a new sysadmin!
