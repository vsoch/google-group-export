Hi Gregory,

Actually I have tried ./test.mop and just test.mop before giving full path, 
to the same effect.

$ ./mopac.sapp ./test.mop
forrtl: No such file or directory
forrtl: severe (29): file not found, unit 26, file 
/global/scratch/myuser/devel/sing-test/./test.out

$ ./mopac.sapp test.mop
forrtl: No such file or directory
forrtl: severe (29): file not found, unit 26, file 
/global/scratch/myuser/devel/sing-test/test.out

On a positive note, the I can start (without inputs, just to see the 
banner) the MOPAC code binaries for Ubuntu, singularized on Ubuntu 14 
machine, on our CentOS 6.6 cluster, and vice versa. This is really great as 
it shows that GLIBC dependency can be worked around with Singulatity. Yet 
both systems show the same behaviour when trying to open output files.
