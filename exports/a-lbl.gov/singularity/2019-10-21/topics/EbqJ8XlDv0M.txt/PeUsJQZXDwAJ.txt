There are no limitations intrinsic to Singularity... But with that said,
I've been playing with the idea of not using sparse images for the images
(instead actually filling the images with zeros) such that they are less
likely to be corrupted on file transfer. I don't think that will make any
difference here, but thought it was worth noting.

You might see a very slight performance degradation as the image is
mounted/unmounted and you can test this easily enough by creating a minimal
small container image and comparing invocation time with a very simple
command:

$ time singularity exec /path/to/container-small.img true
$ time singularity exec /path/to/container-big.img true

The only reason that I can think of is duplicating and backing up your
image. It will take longer if it is giant. But it will take even longer if
you have to deal with multiple images that share lots of data between them
(e.g. glibc, perl, python, etc..).

Hope that helps!
