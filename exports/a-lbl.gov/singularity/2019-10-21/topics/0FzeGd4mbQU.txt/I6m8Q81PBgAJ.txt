Hello,

I'm starting to work with Singularity and still don't know all the details, 
so this may be something obvious, but I couldn't find the answer on my own. 
I am trying to use the gnuplot container built with this description file:


BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%post
   sed -i '/xenial.*universe/s/^#//g' /etc/apt/sources.list
   apt-get -y update
   apt-get -y install gnuplot xorg flashplugin-installer



I want to use it in both a CentOS 6 and a CentOS 7 host. In CentOS 7 
everything goes well. However in CentOS 6 I get: 

ERROR  : No valid /bin/sh in container
ABORT  : Retval = 255

And similar messages, with versions 2.6.0, 2.4.6 and 2.2.1 of Singularity. 
This lack of /bin/sh is something I have seen when creating other 
containers, not just for this gnuplot. In the CentOS 7 host I used just 
version 2.6.0 of Singularity and it worked with no problem. Maybe I did 
something wrong when creating the containers for the older versions of 
Singularity, 2.4.6 and 2.2.1, but I couldn't find documentation for these 
versions, only for 2.5 and 2.6. It seems the build command doesn't exist in 
these older versions, and maybe I'm using "create" wrongly. 

Has anybody experienced something similar?

Thank you!
