So I guess I don't understand why I need to upload an OS to some URL just 
to pull it later? The files I have on my local node should be all the files 
I need to create a local image.. I have a /usr/bin a /usr/local/bin, /opt 
/etc etc, etc, etc. What is preventing me from just creating an image from 
these files directly? 

something like singularity create localimage.img --include 
/usr:/opt:/etc:/sys and so on and so forth? When I look inside a downloaded 
container image for say centos7, all it contains is basically those 
directories and files.
