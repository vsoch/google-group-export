chown is destructive, especially recursively. Is a GID / UID mapping maybe=
=20
an alternative?
Let's say I can map the calling GID/UID to a well-defined SINGULARITY=20
UID/GID which apply during shelling/execution?
When storing user content in a container they'd be owned by SINGULARITY=20
UID/GID=20
I usually do not want to preserve the original UID/GID because then another=
=20
user might have trouble accessing this data.

<div>This would allow our users to build containers the same way they curre=
ntly do on our clusters, without them having to understand any fancy filesy=
stem mounts, overlay semantics, or external build farms.=C2=A0 Coupled with=
 Spack (an entirely user-space
 package manager) they could also easily build their dependencies in the &q=
uot;myuser&quot; directory, without worrying about portability concerns tha=
t arise from differently named home directories on different systems.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Does that make sense, and would it be an easy tweak?=C2=A0 Or am I mis=
sing something?</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>I think that is a great idea! If I am understanding correctly, could a=
n example implementation look like this:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>$ singularity shell --writable ~/container.img</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; echo $PATH</div>
<div>/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:<wbr>/usr/local/bin:/applications/<wbr>b=
in</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; cd ~/git/awesomeness</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; ./configure --prefix=3D/applications &am=
p;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If so, that would be pretty straight forward to implement.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div><br>
</div>
</span>
<div>Yes! =C2=A0if /applications is always owned by &lt;whoever launched th=
e container&gt; then I think this is exactly my use case!</div>
