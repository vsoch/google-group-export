Subject: Re: [Singularity] Celery RabbitMQ worker packaged in a Singularity container

I intented to use multiple instances of separete nodes because of heavy use
of GPUs. I guess that for such usage there would be better to make workers
completely independent as separate instances of containers. The only thing
that I wasn't sure of is the networking part in Singularity, meaning if we
can connect to a remote queue to get a job.
