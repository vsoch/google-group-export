Hello,

This is probably a very simple question, I am just beginning with 
"containers" (singularity and docker) and would like to use for 
bioinformatics, and our sysadmins installed singularity on our cluster.  
I've been going through the documentation and was beginning with trying to 
do things without root access.  The very first program just takes an input 
file and returns some quality metrics.  It's on dockerhub as 
https://hub.docker.com/r/genomicpariscentre/fastqc/ and pull it no problem:

singularity pull --name parisFastQC.img docker://genomicpariscentre/fastqc
 
Is there a way that I can "run" this with just one input file without being 
root?  Would I need to somehow translate the dockerfile into the 
"Singularity" file.  Should I just try to build my own container instead of 
trying to import from docker??

In addition, I would like to eventually move this to common workflow 
language <http://www.commonwl.org/> so that I can create bioinformatics 
workflows, can this be done with singularity??

Thank you very much in advance, I've been going through the tutorials but 
any help appreciated.

Ramiro
