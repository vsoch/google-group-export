This sounds like what GitLab has
<https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/ci/runners/README.md>=
,
and what GitHub
<https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/#simple-p=
ay-as-you-go-pricing>
just added associated with their Actions/CI - you can define a (self
hosted) runner. This is really no different than allowing any general CI
service to perform a build, and then push to Singularity Hub, in which case
Singularity Hub is just being used as storage. The issue here is trust -
when Singularity Hub does the build with it's builder, I can at least be
sure about how the build was done (although I can't be sure about what the
user has put in the container). With a runner, then I would open up trust
to some other entity to push a file, and I would also need to provide
tokens to do it. This would be possible with a self hosted Singularity
Registry, but I don't see doing this any time soon with Singularity Hub,
for the reasons mentioned.

Just curious, what would be your reasons for wanting this supported?
