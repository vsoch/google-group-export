I think the easiest thing to do, if you don't want to pay for some builder
service (e.g., the builders <https://singularityhub.github.io/builders/>
has configurations for Google Cloud) would be to:

1. Develop / put recipes in Github repos
2. Have continuous integration build and test
3. upon success, push to your own sregistry
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry>

Singularity Registry server has a PR in the queue now for nginx upload
module, which has super fast uploads! For the Github --> CI setup, I
created an example and walk through here -->
https://vsoch.github.io/2018/singularity-ci/

Overall, the way I think about it is that there every institution likely
has different wants and needs for hosting and building. The above is
basically putting together different pieces / modules that would give you a
complete solution for your needs. For example, you could decide to instead
build on your own node, but still push to a sregistry. You could decide to
use a different CI service, or skip and build in a cloud somewhere. For the
Singularity Registry server, your users would use it's client
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/> to have an equivalent
local management for containers (e.g., sregistry pull ...)

These are open source projects and have entirely been driven by user needs,
so please give feedback / etc. or reach out if you want help! If you ever
forget the various urls, you can find the portal to most of them here -->
https://singularityhub.github.io/

Happy Building!

Best,

Vanessa
