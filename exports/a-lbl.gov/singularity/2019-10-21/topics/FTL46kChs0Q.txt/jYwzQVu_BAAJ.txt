Actually, this won't work but not necessarily for the reasons that one
would think initially.

Singularity configures a container for the user invoking it. So, for
example, when a user starts a container, the container has that user's
information (e.g. passwd, group, etc) as well as mounts their home
directory. If you invoke the container as root, no other user accounts are
added or configured, so the `su - username` won't generally work (unless it
is a standard system account like "nobody").

Hope that helps!

&gt; Hi Oriol,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Welcome to the group!! You will want to use a boostrap specification (=
a<br>
&gt; build file, akin to a Dockerfile) to create your build, and importantl=
y,<br>
&gt; make it reproducible. The most simple example is to bootstrap an ubunt=
u<br>
&gt; image, and then write your commands in the %post section:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Bootstrap: docker<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install vi<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; etc.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Then to generate the container:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; sudo singularity create --size 3000 ubuntu.img<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; sudo singularity bootstrap ubuntu.img Singularity<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; where &quot;Singularity&quot; is the file with the above!! A good way =
to get started<br>
&gt; would be to look at all the example build files on Singularity Hub<br>
&gt;<br>
