Sure, if you distributed the private key that allows the access to the=20
encrypted container. In my use case, however, I'd prevent this from=20
happening  by having it installed on our cluster with root-only access=20
exclusively.

Aaah took me long to understand what you actually meant: Technically no.=20
You're just not allowed to execute the container ... hehe
Here's another one: If I containerize licensed software into encrypted=20
containers, can I be sued for distributing it? Or just for distributing the=
=20
private key?
