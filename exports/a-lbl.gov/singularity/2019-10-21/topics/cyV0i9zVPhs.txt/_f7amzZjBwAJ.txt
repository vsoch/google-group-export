I suppose that I could try to figure out some way of making it work with 
the environment variables, but it definitely wouldn't be optimal.

The problem is that the containers in our environment are treated as 
somewhat disposable items.  So, Jenkins automatically builds the containers 
on a nightly basis and then they are distributed from a web server.  One 
component of the application has to live on the host, and the directories 
that need the binds vary from day to day and from container to container.  
I could work around it by distributing a wrapper script, but I really like 
the idea of distributing a single file to the host and having our user run 
the application with a minimal amount of input (so that they don't need to 
think about what is going on behind the scenes).

Selfishly, I'm mostly just trying to keep my phone from ringing because 
somebody messed up
