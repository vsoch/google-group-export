On our systems we give staff sudo access to singularity to build images and=
=20
have discovered that some applications built were modifying PATH in=20
/root/.bashrc which caused all sorts of problems when dealing with=20
applications that affect Python functionality on RHEL systems.  I know for=
=20
standard users when "mount home =3D yes" is set then my $HOME will be in=20
container but should this be the case for root?  Is there a way to=20
selectively tell Singularity to not mount $HOME into the container for=20
something like the "shell" subcommand?  Below is the behavior we'd like to=
=20
avoid.  I was able to redefine home by passing "--home /var/tmp:/root" but=
=20
this seems like an ugly hack.  Ideally we'd either be able to disable=20
"mount home" just for root or we'd be able to disable just the home mount=
=20
at command line, but not seeing such an option in help output for "shell"=
=20
subcommand.  This is Singularity 2.4.6 on RHEL 7.4.

Thanks,
