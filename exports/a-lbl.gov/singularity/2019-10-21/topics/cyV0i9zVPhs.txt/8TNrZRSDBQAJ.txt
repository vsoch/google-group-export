Subject: Re: [Singularity] Feature request: Would like to be able to define

Heya Theodore,

Could you instruct your users to set the $SINGULARITY_BINDPATH variable
like so?

export
SINGULARITY_BINDPATH=/dir/on/host:/dir/in/container,/another/dir/on/host:/another/dir/in/container

If your users run this container a lot and always need the same bind paths
then they could put the variable into their .bashrc files.  Or you could
provide a wrapper script that would initiate the var and then call
singularity.  Does that work?
