Hi,
I had build with your definition file on a centos7 VM with 4GB vRAM, and=20
successful.  However, I did notice that the output of "df -h" is showed as=
=20
my  VM "/", which is a 50G LVM.  May I ask what's the VM you are running in=
=20
your MAC?  It seem like mounted tmpfs as "/".

Note: I am building with singularity-3.2

Thank you.

<div><br></div>
I&#39;m using ArchLinux, under qemu, running on a macOS host. But the issue=
 is clearly memory. Singularity seems to take half of the available memory =
