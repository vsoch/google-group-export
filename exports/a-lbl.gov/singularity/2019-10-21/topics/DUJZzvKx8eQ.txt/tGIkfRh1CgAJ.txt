Hi Adam,

The kernel version requirement is difficult to say because some kernel's
have features back ported. Singularity will automatically figure out if it
can do it or not at compile and runtime and gives the system administrator
the ability to toggle options/features if it is a privileged install.

BTW, what I have seen from trial and error... RHEL7 user namespaces is
non-functional, and current Ubuntu works fine. I haven't tested with too
much more then that, but once the release approaches, I will collect
feedback and assemble a support matrix.

Thanks!
