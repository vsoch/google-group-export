From everything I've read, the way to use MPI and Singularity seems to be 
to have the same MPI inside and outside the container (where "the same" 
includes configuration options), and that MPI should probably be OpenMPI 
2.0 or greater. The run command looks like this:

  mpirun -np 4 -hosts file singularity exec my.img myprog

Is that the best practice?

Or is there a way to use the same MPI that's inside the container while on 
the outside?

What I wish I could do is this:

  singularity exec my.img mpirun -np 4 -hosts file singularity exec 
my.img myprog

Then I could have one MPI to rule them all. Obviously, the above doesn't 
work due to permission issues. Thanks.
