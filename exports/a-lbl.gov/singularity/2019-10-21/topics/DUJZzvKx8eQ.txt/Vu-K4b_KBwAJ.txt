Hello again,

The problem is that on the system where I do not have root/sudo access 
singularity can only be installed at the user level. So yes I can create 
and manipulate the image on a different system where I have root/sudo 
privileges but I ultimately need to use such image on the system where I do 
not have root/sudo privileges. Currently with my user installed version of 
singularity on the system where I do not have root/sudo access I am unable 
to use the image created elsewhere (where I do have root privileges). 

Will any current development version of singularity installed as a simple 
user on a system where that user does not have root/sudo abilities be able 
to use an image created elsewhere? 

Or as long as I am on a centos 6.8 box the only way to make singularity 
able to use an image (created elsewhere) is to have singularity installed 
by root?

Thanks,

rd

 no. Yes in that there is slightly more overhead in the loop bind of the im=
age which will save about 5-7 thousandths of a second when using a base dir=
ectory, but you may quickly loose that benefit with dealing with parallel c=
ontainer execution when the container is on a network file system (especial=
ly a parallel file system) as metadata lookups are expensive. For large sca=
