I'm trying to deploy Singularity on our Linux cluster, and as an initial 
test I run the tutorial in https://singularity-tutorial.github.io/ 

The tutorial instructions fail, however, when I try to build the lolcow 
container in a normal user's home directory: 

$ sudo singularity build --sandbox lolcow Singularity 
[sudo] password for XXX: 
Building into existing container: lolcow 
Using container recipe deffile: Singularity 
tar: .: Cannot utime: Permission denied 
tar: .: Cannot change ownership to uid 0, gid 0: Operation not permitted 
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors 
ERROR: Failed to export contents of Singularity to lolcow 
ABORT: Aborting with RETVAL=255 
Cleaning up... 

The reason is very obvious: User home directories are NFS mounted without 
root permissions to the NFS clients (and obviously so, I'd say!). 

Request: Please update the tutorial homepage by explicitly instructing 
users to build containers on a locally mounted storage, for example /tmp. 

Request for enhancement: The "singularity build" command should check for 
root access to the current working directory, and exit with a nice and 
informative message if this condition is not fulfilled. 

Thanks, 
Ole
