 bug fix point release to the 2.4 feature branch, and includes a number of =
bug fixes as well as a security related fix that affects Singularity runnin=

 possible for a malicious user to keep a directory open pointing to anythin=
g on the host filesystem within a container in such a manner that would byp=
ass the security precautions already in place. Hosts that do not support th=
e `prctl()` function `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` are at risk. Most current distri=
butions of Linux support this feature (e.g. RHEL6 with kernels newer then 2=
.6.32-504.16.2), and it is recommended to update to the latest upstream dis=
tribution release if you can.=C2=A0<br>
