Thanks! I guess that was the issue. At least our admin seemed to know where=
 the problem was and just fixed it.

Now I am getting:

bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF8)=00

Is this also related to an similar cause, like folders being removed or so?=
 Or isn=E2=80=98t this related to singularity anymore?

Thank you!

With locale I get:
>locale
LANG=3Den_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION=3D"en_US.UTF-8"
