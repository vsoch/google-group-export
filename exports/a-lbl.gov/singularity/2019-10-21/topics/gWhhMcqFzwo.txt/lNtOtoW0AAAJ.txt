Ok, I went back and reread your original post... this is only happening in 
the home dir?

This occurs on systems that use autofs for home directories. This is why in 
/home you only see your own directory whereas on your laptop you see 
everything.

If you were to create a directory somewhere else like:

mkdir /tmp/somedir
singularity shell -H /tmp/somedir your_image_name.simg
ls /home

you will see the missing directories. It's a little weird and unexpected, 
but that is exactly what's causing the behavior.
