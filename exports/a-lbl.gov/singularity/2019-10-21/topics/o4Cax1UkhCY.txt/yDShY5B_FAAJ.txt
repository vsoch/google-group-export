Hello Vanessa,

I think the sci-f proposal looks interesting. I'll see if I can give your 
development branch a try later in the week. I suppose the short example I 
gave is just a *very* small portion I was working on to see if I could 
avoid any external preprocessor steps since the documentation states that 
the container setup should be within a single file. I'd like to follow this 
logic and I think at the very minimal, having a basic string substitution 
similar to what can be done within an RPM spec file (i.e., %global) would 
be extremely helpful in writing less error prone recipes and improved 
automation capability. I see no reason why this couldn't be integrated as a 
use case.

I think the "app" idea is quite solid. My first goal for using containers 
is to build complete working environments, not necessarily single 
applications (even though others may ask if the container is doing too 
much). It's the more complex environments which I'm attempting to control 
for my end users or software which perhaps doesn't work well on the cluster 
host OS. I can see how the "app" could facilitate these complex workflows 
especially if it has some sort of "app" specific pre/post segments. If we 
extend my basic snippet out further to supply Rstudio, then running either 
R (Rscript, etc.) or Rstudio could have independent starting mechanisms 
built into the container. TBH, most of our current users have no idea their 
workflow is actually running from a container because I will often provide 
wrapper scripts for launching the containers (i.e., R) as it would if you 
just called the application normally. It'd be great if I can simplify these 
wrapper scripts.

Thanks,

Jared
