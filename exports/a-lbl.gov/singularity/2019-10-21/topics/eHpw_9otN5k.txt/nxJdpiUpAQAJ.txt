I'm using version 2.0.  I had originally been working on a Centos 6 system=
=20
(with a Centos 7.2 container), but then moved to Centos 7.2.  I didn't have=

this problem running on Centos 6, but it's possible I might have done=20
something different.  FYI, I moved to Centos 7 because I was having some=20
dependency issues building the latest version of MPI.

[root@mach0 ~]# singularity --version
