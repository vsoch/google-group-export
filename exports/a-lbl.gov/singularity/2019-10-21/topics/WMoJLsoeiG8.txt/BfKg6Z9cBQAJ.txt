While it is possible (in theory), we have to be very much aware of how we
use our SetUID abilities, and we purposefully drop all capabilities when we
exec to a process within the container. The only way someone could actually
run an ssh daemon inside the container is to run the container as root.

You could do that but `nsenter` or rather the system call `setns()` implies
a running container instance. With Singularity, you don't need that, and
you can just use the Singularity shell idea I mentioned earlier, or the
(very simple and clean) solution that Jeff mentioned. But... If you want to
instead join an existing set of namespaces, Singularity supports that with
instances, however I'm not sure a running instance is required.

We can use the user namespace, without SetUID, now for this (if you are not
using file based images). But you are right, Cedric's PR there is highly
advantageous.

Yes, ch-ssh may offer a similar functionally to what I was describing (with
a Singularity login shell), but I think that Jeff's idea is much cleaner.

Great ideas!
