Hi Ivan,

There are several ways to handle this depending on your goal. If you want
/run to be isolated from the host system, I would recommend just creating
/run inside your container, and create the necessary directories and links
that your application will require. But if you don't mind the blur between
host and container, I would recommend adding /run to the bind path in
host's singularity.conf.

Let me know how that works for you!

Greg
