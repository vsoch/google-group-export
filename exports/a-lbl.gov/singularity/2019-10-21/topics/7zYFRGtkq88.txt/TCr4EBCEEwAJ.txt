Answers to Nekel-Seyew:
> Can you clarify what you meant by " I can only run with unprivileged user
(root)"? Do you mean that you only run as root inside the container? Or do
you mean you cannot run as root inside the container?
First of all, there was a bloody stupid type: It should be "run with
PRIVILEGED user (root)" instead of "run with unprivileged user (root)".
By saying running with certain type of user I meant launching the container
(calling singularity).

> How are you launching the container? Are you calling it as "sudo
singularity cent-7.img" or "singularity cent-7.img?"
Launch as root: singularity cent-7.img
Launch as non-root: sudo singularity cent-7.img  ==> In this case I
actually became root in the container

Answers to Tru
> How was the Centos-7 container built? from docker or bootstrap'ed with
yum ? on CentOS-7 host or CentOS-6 host? Same questions for your CentOS-6
container.
Both containers were bootstrap'ed with yum on a RHEL6 host.
