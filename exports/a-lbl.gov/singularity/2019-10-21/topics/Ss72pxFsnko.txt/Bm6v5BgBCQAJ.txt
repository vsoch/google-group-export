Hi,

I have installed singularity 2.3.1 on a CentOS cluster (with root). I see 
the following when I try to create a container as a user (non-root)
$singularity create centos7.img 
Initializing Singularity image subsystem 
Opening image file: centos7.img 
Creating 768MiB image 
Binding image to loop 
ERROR : The feature you are requesting requires privilege you do not have 
ABORT : Retval = 255

However, I do not have any problem if I execute above command as root. What 
am I missing? Any help?

Thank you
Prasad
