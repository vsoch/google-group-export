The only way someone could actually run an ssh daemon inside the container is to run the container as root.
We are already letting HTCondor run an sshd as user inside our Singularity containers. 
So our users can run
condor_submit -interactive
on a desktop machine, and end up inside a Singularity container on a worker node. 

This naturally means privilege separation is disabled, and sshd can of course only let the single user in - but this is exactly the way it's meant to be (in the HTCondor world) and the way HTCondor is also using when running bare-metal. 
The main issues why we still need SetUID-capabilities are related to the permissions, owners and groups on the devpts filesystem in the container, which sshd is very picky about. In a user namespace, there's no easy fix (apart from patching sshd). 

HTCondor takes care to set up such a temporary sshd with one-time credentials for each user who wants to attach to an owned, running job. Sadly, it does that in a *separate* container to the original job right now, which is a bit useless,
but at least allows to run interactive jobs at all.

With Singularity, you don't need that, and you can just use the Singularity shell idea I mentioned earlier, or the (very simple and clean) solution that Jeff mentioned. But... If you want to instead join an existing set of namespaces, Singularity supports that with instances, however I'm not sure a running instance is required.
I can't use the Singularity shell idea for our setup without doing one of two things:
- Grant the users SSH access to our worker nodes. I don't want to do that - they are in a private network behind a NAT gateway. The only access users get is via the reverse connections initiated by HTCondor. 
  This also ensures HTCondor is completely aware of anything user-related running on those machines. 
- Rewriting the logic of HTCondor. Currently, it always (no matter whether bare metal or container) fires up a dummy job in case an interactive job is requested (it just runs a "sleep 180" job). 
  Then, the "ssh-to-job" approach is used, as if one would attach to a "real" running job. The idea is to enter the exact same environment of the job. 

For this, of course either nsenter or instances would be fully working ideas. I suggested both on the HTCondor list a while ago, sadly there's still no reply... 

But of course, I see many other applications in other environments for the Singularity shell, so I greet the idea ;-).

With nsenter, there's a huge problem without Cedric's PR in: When using nsenter to attach the container, you end up in the same mount namespace, but with / being the root of the host. 
With Cedric's PR, this is resolved (due to the use of pivot_root). 
That's why I would say that at least the "nsenter" approach requires this PR to be in to be useful.

Thanks! 

Maybe another question, just since I did not test it yet - do Singularity's instances work also when Singularity is not setuid root?

If possible, I would like users to access a cluster and be instantly transported into the Singularity container. Steven Brandt posted some code recently, and I have some hacky code that allows remote command execution, but I am stuck on scp file transfer:

Furthermore, is this even sane, are other people considering this? If so, could Singularity handle all the logic about what to do itself, or does it need some boilerplate wrapper?
