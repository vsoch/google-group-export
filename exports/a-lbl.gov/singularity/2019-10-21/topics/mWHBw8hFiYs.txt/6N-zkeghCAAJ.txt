Thank you so much Vanessa! So I am a little embarrassed that I didn't read 
the documentation enough to realize there is now a %environment header, but 
that did fix the persistence of the JULIA_PKGDIR environmental variable. I 
also took your advice and adjusted to create a new root folder (/opt seemed 
to be taken in my vagrant vm so used /duncanidaho) but this has created a 
new problem that on the cluster I don't have root permissions and so the 
/duncanidaho/.julia files are "Permission Denied" when trying to use my 
package in julia on sherlock. 

I tried to implement what you were suggesting with the binding paths, but I 
don't think I full understand, as I can bind a folder based in my scratch 
into my container, but not vice versa as far as I can tell (singularity 
shell -B ~:/duncanidaho test.simg). But it seems like a better solution for 
me would to locate the packages in a location where I have permission for 
them. My attempt at a relative path in my user account 
($HOME/duncanidaho/.julia) didn't seem to work either though.

I'll try to post more code tomorrow if you think that would help. Thanks 
again for all your help and looking forward to figuring this out! There are 
a ton of package versioning issues in julia right now due to the intense 
development and I need a container system for some image analysis pipelines 
I'm working on. I'm pretty sure singularity is perfect for the task, I just 
need a little help figuring out these hiccups :)

Cheers!
Andrew
