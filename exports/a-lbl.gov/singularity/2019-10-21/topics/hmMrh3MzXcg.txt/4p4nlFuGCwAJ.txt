Hi,

I'm having problem building image from recipe. I'm trying to download and 
unzip two large files (around 1.5 Gb and 0.5Gb), and I get following error: 

Not enough space on parition mounted at /tmp.
> Need 2575128224 bytes.
>
> Not enough space on parition mounted at /.
> Need 2575128224 bytes.
>

 But if I run all the commands in sandbox, there is no problem with space. 
My disk is like 20% in use, so there is plenty of space available. Do i 
need to specify size of image somewhere? I'm running in circles, and I 
can't figure out the right answer. Thanks for your help.
