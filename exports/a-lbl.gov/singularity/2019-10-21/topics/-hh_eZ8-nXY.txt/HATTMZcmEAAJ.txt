Hello everyone,

  My name is Mike Moore.  I am an HPC Systems Engineer at Nuance 
Communications.  I am running a project to introduce container technology 
into our HPC environments and guide our users/developers to containerize 
their HPC/AI workloads using Singularity.  We are deploying several 
sregistry VM's into HPC Grids as a POC to enable our users to work with 
Singularity.  I have several questions about sregistry in regards to 
multi-site deployment and how to tune it for scalability.  I'm hoping the 
experts here can share some of the lessons they have learned when blazing 
the path.

Multi-server sregistry deployment:

We have multiple, separate HPC grids in different regions around the world 
for various regulatory compliance needs.  We run similar workloads in these 
environment, just with different datasets.  We will have at least one 
sregistry server running in each environment to host the container images 
and serve the out fast enough for the jobs.  Our WAN backbone isn't 
sufficient to support a single centralized sregistry server 
infrastructure.  My questions are:

   1. Has anyone deployed a similar model with sregistry?
   2. If so, how have you kept the separate instances in-sync?  
   3. Is there any built-in replication functionality that we could take 
   advantage of to mirror the container images/metadata to the other regions?
   4. If you are not running sregistry, what did you do for hosting your 
   container images?
   5. We are using LDAP for authentication within Singularity.  Is there 
   any way to keep the per-user tokens in sync between instances of sregistry?
   
Tuning/Scalability:

So, currently we have ~2000 nodes in our various HPC environments.  Our 
smaller environments are on the order of 100-200 nodes.  Our largest is 
north of 1200.  We have a mix of CPU and GPU compute nodes.  CPU nodes have 
a max capacity of 8 to 20 jobs based on CPU type.  Our GPU nodes have a max 
capacity of 2 to 16 jobs, again based on GPU type.  We have a run-rate of 
~30-50 million jobs per month in our largest environment.  I am wondering 
if:


   1. Has anyone run sregistry in an environment this big?  
   2. If not, any alternative suggestions for a container repository or 
   image storage that is compatible with Singularity?
   3. If you don't mind sharing, what does your sregistry infrastructure 
   look like?  
   4. I've started testing an sregistry VM setup following the direction on 
   the sregistry page.  However, it does not seem to handle simultaneous 
   connections well (1 upload and 1 download).  Are there any recommendations 
   for parameters for nginx?

One final question..  Does Singularity support the cryptographic signing of 
images yet?  If not, any plans/timeframe for when it will?


Thank you,


-Mike Moore
