Interesting! Thanks for the info. I heard of Firecracker, but as an Amazon
product
<https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/>
and my takeaway was that it was the AWS effort to get into the space (via
an open source project). It also seems to be scoped for "serverless" pay as
you go as opposed to a research cluster (SLURM, etc.)

I'm all for getting excited about new things! So much, in fact, that I've
learned to step back and ask if said new thing is really badly needed. The
answer to that question, of course, depends on the communit(ies) you put
your hat on to think for, and things that you want to do that aren't
afforded by existing technologies.

If anyone else has cool learnings from FOSDEM, please share on the list!
