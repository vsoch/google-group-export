Subject: suid binaries with singularity

Hi List,
so I'm trying to determine if there is a way to bring SUID binaries from
the hosts namespace into the name space used in the container. Concretely I
have two problems

1) I'd like to put X2go (an NX server) inside a container and use it with
virtualgl. For virtualgl to work it needs an X server (a real one running
on the GPUs) and it LOOKS (see foot note) like this would be easiest if the
X server were in the same namespace as the NX server. Of course the X
server is SUID root, so if its part of the container filesystem, the SUID
bit is not allowed

2) I'd like to put a whole desktop (nx or vnc server, plus window manager)
inside an singularity name space and then execute applications also in
singularity containers. @v has made a wonderful demonstration of how this
is possible using sudo, but as a general rule I don't give my users sudo
access ;-)

One way I can think of to allow these use cases is to selectively mount
binaries from the root name space to be bind mounted into the container
preserving the SUID bit

Does anyone else have any clever ideas? Are my use cases too silly to
contemplate or do others have similar problems? Also feel free to correct
my use of the terms "container" "host namespace" and "container namespace"
etc. I feel like I've been very sloppy in my description and its going to
lead to additional confusion :-P

footnote: I say "looks". I now there is some problem in communication
between the X server in the root name space and the nx server in the
container name space, but I'm not sure what it is. virtualgl is a bit magic
and not that well documented IMHO. I'm also investigating how to make this
happen without preserving SUID bits in the container.

Cheers,
--
Chris.
