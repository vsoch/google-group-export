Hi Harry,

No worries on the distraction, I totally understand! I spent a lot of time
working on the dependency solvers and optimizing the modules which are
present. With that said, I don't even have a proper solver for Matlab at
present, so I'm hopeful but surprised if it works right off the bat. With
that said, your results are very encouraging!

Do you remember what I said about executing the SAPP file directly having a
different caching paradigm then installing it and then running it? Well,
scratch that. Now it always caches/installs in the same manner (which is in
the user's home directory). Hrmm... I may need to update some documentation
as well as eat a bunch of my words. In any case, you can get around this by
exporting the environment variable "SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR" and point it to a
local directory (maybe /var/tmp, or /var/cache/singularity/[username] with
the appropriate permissions).

Also, note that once a SAPP file has been installed into Singularity
(either by running "singularity install file.sapp" or by executing the
container directly "./file.sapp") you will see it in the output of
"singularity list". And once it has been installed, you can strace it from
within the container using "singularity strace [name]" (notice [name] !=
the SAPP file name).

Let me know how it goes with the SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR being set!

Thanks!
