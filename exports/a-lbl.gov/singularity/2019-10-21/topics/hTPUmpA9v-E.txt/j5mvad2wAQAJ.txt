The SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR is generally used for caching images, or in the
case of Docker, layers and metadata. Others can add more detail, but the
temp versions of that (I think) are used for things like building the root
file system, overlays, etc.

From the code I deduce I should set &quot;SINGULARITY_TMPDIR&quot; to overr=

<br>

<br>
So this variable seems to be used internally in some cases? And then it&#39=
;s actually derived from SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR, or in one case even SINGULAR=
Y_LOCALCACHEDIR?<br>
<br>
Is this wild mixup just a set of bugs I should all file as issues?<br>
<br>
This overview of environment variables would be really good to have, since =
it seems even the developers don&#39;t have a clean consistent idea of whic=
h variable should be used for what -<br>
or I am misreading the code ;-).<br>
For us users, it would be cool to just have one defined way to specify a ca=

t stuff) singularity should use...<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; This information (and especially=
 a clean control of the directory which is used) is crucial to provide enou=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Is &quot;SINGULARITY_ROOTFS&quot=

)?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; It already took me quite a while=
 to find out about SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR which on the automated build machin=

&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I second getting more information abo=
ut these variables. We hit similar<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0problems with 2.4 today as well. We r=
ecognize we are on the early side<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0of things and that documentation is f=
orth-coming. One of my researchers<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0has a known bug fixed in 2.4 so he po=
unced me the moment I walked in<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0today to get 2.4 installed on the clu=
ster. :-)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I got him going again, but I&#39;d li=
