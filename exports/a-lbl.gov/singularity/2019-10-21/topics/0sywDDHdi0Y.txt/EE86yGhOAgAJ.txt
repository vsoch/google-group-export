Singularity is fully supported by OMPI (and vice versa). If you grab a copy=
 of the OMPI master and build it =E2=80=94with-singularity=3D<path-to-singu=
larity> (or have the singularity path in your default path), then all you h=
ave to do is use mpirun as you normally do, but provide the container as yo=
ur =E2=80=9Capp=E2=80=9D.

We=E2=80=99ll take care of the rest. Our initial studies showed zero perfor=
mance degradation by running inside Singularity, and the launch penalty is =
near-zero as well (and gets better when compared against dl_open=E2=80=99d =
dynamic jobs running at scale). I=E2=80=99ll let Greg answer the question o=
f how to address the running container.
