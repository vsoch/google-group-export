Thanks R=C3=A9my,

But actually I want to do is the inverse. I provide the files though the=20
container, and I'd like to bind/mount a directory from the container=20
to the host with 777 permission for example (automatically via bootstrap).
Or, simply give write access to this folder 777 for user (independently of=
=20
the machine), but currently I can't run an image with "-w/--writable"=20
option without using sudo,
(I get ERROR  : Could not open image (read/write) ).
but maybe it's a problem of my install or the version ?

Best

Guillaume
