Hi Dave,

Thank you so much for your long response. Indeed, I have to say yes to all =
your questions.=20

I work at the high-performances computing center Romeo at the University of=
 Reims and our supercomputer embeds two NVIDIA GPU per node. Also we use Sl=
urm to provide our many end-users a way to enqueue their jobs using MPI mos=
t of the time.=20

The main reason for us to be interested by Singularity is that we will soon=
 install a new supercomputer with this similar workflow and the old one wil=
l become a research Cloud for simplicity and flexibility provided by this s=
olution. But we want to provide a non-exhaustive way to switch between Open=
stack and HPC environment for our users and so does Singularity by making c=
ontainers flexible and reusable on any different machine with a similar arc=
hitecture. The workflow would be awesome if OpenStack could support Singula=
rity as an hypervisor : an user may continue to compute with the same image=
 on the Cloud if he can=E2=80=99t submit his job within the HPC environment=
.=20

All your precisions are really hyping for such a solution !
