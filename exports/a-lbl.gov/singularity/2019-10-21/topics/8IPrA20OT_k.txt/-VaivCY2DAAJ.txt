Yes, SquashFS is quite possible! But... I am curious how this will allow
someone to create a Singularity image without root access? They would have
to still build the chroot directory, right? Or maybe pull files from the
host OS?

Can you elaborate on this?

Ahh, yes! Would it be reasonable to also do this with the default
Singularity image (uses ext3 on the backend)?

Technically, this could make it into 2.2 but if it will be dependent on the
timeline. I'd like to have 2.2 released before October. If I get caught up
on the other features I'm working on and have time, I will start working on
these!

Great thinking, thank you!
