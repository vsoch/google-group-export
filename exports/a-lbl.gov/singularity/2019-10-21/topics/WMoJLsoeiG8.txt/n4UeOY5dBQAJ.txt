Comment from the peanut gallery...

this is the greatest idea!! It will be akin to this "clusterjob" that
implemented http://clusterjob.org/documentation/book.html but didn't quite
hit the mark because it required very specific needs for the executables
and how they were formatted.

Can't wait to see some of these examples in action!
