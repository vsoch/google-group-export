Subject: Re: Bug found in v2.1 - container locking
To: singularity <singu...@lbl.gov>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a1142c5181539140538cf1c7f

If anyone needs a quick fix or wish to test, please pull the 2.x branch and
rebuild from there. I set it such that the only root calling user has the
ability to mount --writable and it doesn't try to obtain a lock unless
--writable is passed and it is the root user requesting it.

So shared locking will never occur on the image, and exclusive locking only
occurs when making changes to the image (and now it also just warns if it
can't obtain a lock).

Thanks and sorry for the issue!
