Hi Jonathon,

The biggest issue with installing to NFS is the localstatedir that you
already pointed out.  As long as you make that local and create it on each
node I think you should be OK.  Greg has pointed out some other reasons to
prefer installing via RPM over building from source.  They mostly boil down
to having the ability to track, audit, and prescriptively define specifics
about your installation.

Dave
