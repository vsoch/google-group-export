I'm running into the same issue. Building on cloud.sylabs.io/builder 
doesn't seem to support moving files in either the %setup or %files section 
(giving "cp: cannot stat 'example.txt': No such file or directory" and 
"unable to copy files to container fs" errors respectively). 

I'd like to be able to build a container that includes software for which I 
have an academic licence, but for which I don't have permission to 
redistribute. These legal limits preclude sharing the files with the 
builder via github or other public endpoint. Is the only option we have 
then to convert the definitions to Dockerfiles, use private Docker Hub 
repositories and then clone from there?

Thanks!
