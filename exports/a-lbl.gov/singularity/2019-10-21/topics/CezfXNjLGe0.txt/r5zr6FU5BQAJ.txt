As long as you are throwing things at the wall to see what sticks... :-)=20
 You might have a look here:

https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/singularity.html#gpu

It's a guide I wrote for our users to get a GPU up and running with a=20
TensorFlow example.  Might not work exactly in your case b/c it is specific=
=20
to our hardware.  But you might be able to tweak things a little to get up=
=20
and running. =20
