In my case, it's always about single user, sitting at given machine.

It's simply just about to avoid multi-boot, or using VirtualBox/VMware.  
For example, let's say that CentOS is installed on given machine, but that 
from time to time, one would like to use openSUSE, or Ubuntu.  Obviously, 
one could mess with partitioning, boot manager etc. and install all three 
together - the disadvantage is complicated setup.  The second option is to 
install for example VirtualBox, and then install openSUSE and Ubuntu there 
- the disadvantage here is performance loss because of running within 
virtual machine.  So using containers seemed to me as an approach worth 
trying - it's the same reasoning that makes container so popular.  But the 
difference here is that I'd like to run full desktop environment in 
container.  With multi-boot, or virtual machine, it's obviously possible, 
but with containers, it seems that there are some issues...
