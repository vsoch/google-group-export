Hi Eliot,

I also think it's better to make driver agnostic container image, like
nvidia-docker. Otherwise, it's a pain to install same version of driver
inside container. But it should be a more genetic feature, not just nvidia
driver, also include IB driver, AMD GPU driver, Intel Xeon Phi driver, etc.
