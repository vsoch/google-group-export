Hi Sananad,

as of 2.2 version, it will be easier trying to create a Singularity
definition file with the docker bootstrap method.

As you can see in
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/master/examples/docker.def
you can select the docker image to pull from the registry and build your
Singularity container based on that docker image.

Regards,
