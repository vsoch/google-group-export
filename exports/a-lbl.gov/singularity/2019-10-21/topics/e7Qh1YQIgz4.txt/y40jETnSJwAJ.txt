Heya everyone,

I wanted to share a brief summary and pointer to what I've been working on.
Namely getting Singularity container images working, and extending the
container use case to support operating system dependency resolution.

You can read more about it as I update the README here:

   https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity/blob/master/README.md

I am looking for feedback, comments and use-cases!

Thanks!
