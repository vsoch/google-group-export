Hey Stefan!

Apologies for the delay on this - I believe I found the bug, here is what I
get working now (and a preview of pull!)

https://asciinema.org/a/121536?speed=2

Would you be able to test on your end? This isn't merged into development
yet, it is in this PR:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/677

The bug was (as they always are) just an oversight on my part - the auth
(that used to be passed around functions in a variable) is now stored with
the client object, and I had the function still checking for its provided
auth:

if auth is not None:
>     headers.update(self.auth)


but not the client instances, eg, I would have needed to add this:

elif self.auth is not None:
>     headers.update(self.auth)


so it would only work to update the token given that auth was provided to
the function (as it used to be) but not if the update_token() function was
called after the initial creation (which was our case, so auth would =
None). Now we take the approach that, if an auth is provided, it takes
preference over the client's auth, but if no auth is provided (what was
happening for us) we again check if the client was instantiated with one.

I hope this works on your end too!

And I'm super excited about your Windows apps! No worries if you need to
tweak some things, I will be happy to wait patiently for some wonderful
container that has potential to make me again become addicted to some
computer game and forget I need to do.. all the adult things!

Best,

Vanessa
