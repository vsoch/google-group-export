Hi Vanessa,
I understand your point but I really don't like to send everything I need=
=20
to be converted to a singularity image to dockerhub. I imagine that=20
everyone who needs to convert a docker image to a singularity one has=20
already installed on the system docker so it would be really nice to have a=
=20
way to build the docker image in our computer and convert them in loco. I'm=
=20
not an expert of layers, metadata etc and so I cannot help more on this=20
side but I think that a proper image conversion should pass also the=20
environmental variable present in that image. I don't know whether I am=20
expressing myself correctly but I would like to use the singularity image=
=20
in "shell" mode in the same way we use docker run -it...=20

Many thanks again,

Luca

<br>&gt;&gt; Hey Luca,
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Ah yes, I know docker2singularity well because I wrote most of=
 the runtime
<br>&gt;&gt; script, that somehow was scraped of any credit via improper us=
e of version
<br>&gt;&gt; control, lol. When you export the docker environment using tha=
t script,it
<br>&gt;&gt; writes directly to a file /environment, which mirrors how the =
very first
<br>&gt;&gt; singularity images were set up. Later images (made with singul=
arity proper)
<br>&gt;&gt; store the docker environment variables in the image&#39;s meta=
data &quot;env&quot; folder,
<br>&gt;&gt; available via shell or exec with a simple source:
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for script in /.singularity.d/env/*.sh; do
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 if [ -f &quot;$script&quot; ]; thenHere is w=
here
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 . &quot;$script&quot;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 fi
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; done
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; so you don&#39;t have the environment variables because they a=
ren&#39;t being
<br>&gt;&gt; sourced. The option with -e would clean the environment from y=
our host, not
<br>&gt;&gt; what is in the container. Here is where some of this happens, =
if it helps.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; I think if you want this to work as expected, you should put y=
our docker
<br>&gt;&gt; image on docker hub, and then bootstrap appropriately:
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; singularity create image.img
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; sudo singularity bootstrap image.img Singularity
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; This will handle the Docker environment to coincide with the c=
urrent
<br>&gt;&gt; implementation that sources it. Give that a go and see if it h=
elps.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Best,

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Luca,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you don&#39;t want &quot;every environmental va=
riables not specified in the
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; docker image out of it.&quot; do you mean removing=
 variables from the Docker
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; image, or ones that you have defined in another si=
ngularity image? Could you
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; please provide a toy example of your issue, with t=
he current output and the
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; desired? Thanks!

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Vanessa,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many thanks for your answer.
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When converting the image with &quot;import&qu=

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environmental variables not specified in the d=

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m also having problem with singularity s=

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option -e is still keeping the ENV variables.
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many thanks.

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Luca,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you convert from Docker, Singularity =
will automatically grab the
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ENV variables that you&#39;ve defined, so =
you shouldn&#39;t need to specify it
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice. Which of the two are you wanting to=
 not use? You can easily remove
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the extra specification from %environment.=
 If you want to disable
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; singularity adding, we don&#39;t have any =
kind of flag for that (but it could be
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily added).
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
