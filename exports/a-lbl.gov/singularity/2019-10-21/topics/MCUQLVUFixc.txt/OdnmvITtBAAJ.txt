Hello, 

we are having issues running MPI applications compiled with OpenMPI with 
Singularity on SGE cluster. 

We are using the following versions:

   - singularity 2.4.2
   - openmpi 2.1.2 (compiled with --with-sge --disable-pmix-dstore)
   - son of grid engine 8.1.2

Worker nodes are using CentOS 6 and container is CentOS 7 (though we tried 
with CentOS 6 too). Both host and container have the same OpenMPI version.


We performed tests with NAS Parallel Benchmarks on a single node (bt, class 
C, nprocs 9).


Here is the list of scenarios:

   - running mpirun directly on worker node - OK
   - running mpirun through SGE - OK
   - running mpirun + singularity directly on worker node - OK
   - running mpirun + singularity through SGE - FAIL

mpirun reports the following error:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like MPI_INIT failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during MPI_INIT; some of which are due to configuration or environment
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI
developer):

  ompi_mpi_init: ompi_rte_init failed
  --> Returned "(null)" (-43) instead of "Success" (0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


There is nothing useful in system or SGE logs.


We assume that the problem is somewhere in SGE integration but we were not 
able to find anything useful on this list. Most of topics including this 
error are related to different openmpi versions between host and container, 
but its not the case here.


Any help would be appreciated :)


Best regards

Emir Imamagic
