If I understand the user name space correctly, which I don't assume I do,
it doesn't seem like this would add much in terms of security. This is
because the unprivileged user can invoke the user name space, reset their
UID within that context to anything they want. Themselves or maxuid-1.

Are you thinking that the SETUID workflow could in fact do more with the
user name space to limit security even more? If so, I'm all ears!

I've been challenging the developers to consider how to use the user name
space to "fake root" such that we can run typically root only workflows as
an unprivileged user. It's something we've been thinking through and open
to ideas here as well.
