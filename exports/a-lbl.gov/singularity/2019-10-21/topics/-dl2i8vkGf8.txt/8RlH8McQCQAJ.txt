Hi Gregory and Tru,

Thanks for the answers. Indeed, you convinced me that runC does not
substitute Singularity now.

But I still have some doubts about the future of Singularity ... when runC
becomes a part of each linux distribution. Docker since 1.11 uses runC as a
backend. And runC is a standard since last Summer. Although for now runc is
not a part of each linux distro, I have feeling it will be. So I wonder if
you, Gregory, is thinking about using runC as a backend keeping all the
current Singularity features.

Best regards,

Taras

Of course that not an issue if your are running a recent linux distribution=
