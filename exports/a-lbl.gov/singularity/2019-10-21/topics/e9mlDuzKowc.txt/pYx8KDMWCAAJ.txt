Hi Brian,

Thanks very much for the suggestion on that - I'll give that a try when 
resource is available. There is a single top level docker image which is 
managed by us, so it would only be the singularity images which are user 
provided.

Just having a quick look with pscap and comparing docker on my real (where 
is doesn't work) and test (where it does work) systems the capabilities 
look the same, but I will give the explicit SYS_ADMIN capability a try:

Real:
6881  6882  root        docker            full
6882  25028 root        supervisord       chown, dac_override, fowner, 
fsetid, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net_bind_service, net_raw, 
sys_chroot, mknod, audit_write, setfcap

Test:
1     1432  root        docker-current    full
1432  2042  root        supervisord       chown, dac_override, fowner, 
fsetid, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net_bind_service, net_raw, 
sys_chroot, mknod, audit_write, setfcap
 
Thanks,

Chris

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have &quot;allow pid ns =3D no&quot; as this was als=
o kicking up an error. I&#39;ve
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tried setting all mount options in the conf to no.
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same command from the same installation works fine=
 on the bare metal
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system.
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions of what might be the =
issue or at least
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where to start looking?
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks very much,
