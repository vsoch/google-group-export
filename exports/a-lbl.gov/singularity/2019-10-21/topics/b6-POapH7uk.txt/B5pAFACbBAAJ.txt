Hi Adam,

I can't comment on previous behavior for this and the change you notice,
but do you need to access these directories during bootstrap? If you need
to do things with paths relative to the host during boostrap, you can do
this in the %setup section and access any path on your local machine. If
you want to add custom files, with version 2.3 (on development branch) you
can add a %files section as a single list with LOCAL CONTAINER paths of
files to add. If your runtime environment doesn't allow creation of
directories that don't exist, make sure to add them in the container during
bootstrap as well. Then, when you run/shell/exec your container, if the
paths aren't mounted by default, you can do so with --bind. Does this
address some of your issue?

Best,

Vanessa
