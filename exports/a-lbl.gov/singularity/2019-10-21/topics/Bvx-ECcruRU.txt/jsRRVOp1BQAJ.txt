Thanks a lot for the reply Cedric. This was very helpful.
After digging some more, i think --writable-tmpfs can help me out too.=20
However, It looks like there is a limit of 1MB on it right now.
Am I correct?
How can I increase that limit?

    <div>Hi Ankit,<br>
      <br>
      I don&#39;t clearly understand what you means by &quot;not expose&quo=
t; because
      everything put in overlay image is exposed to user.<br>
      Yes v3 doesn&#39;t provide a way to generate/manipulate ext3 image.<b=
r>
      <br>
      But you can easily produce an ext3 overlay image with something
      like :<br>
      <br>
      <font face=3D"Courier New, Courier, monospace">----------------------=
--------<wbr>----------</font><br>
      <font face=3D"Courier New, Courier, monospace">#!/bin/sh<br>
        <br>
        umask 0022<br>
        image=3D$1<br>
        tmproot=3D`mktemp -d`<br>
        dd if=3D/dev/zero of=3D$image bs=3D1M count=3D$2<br>
        # create ext3 root directory layer<br>
        mkdir $tmproot/upper<br>
        mkdir $tmproot/work<br>
        mkfs.ext3 -d $tmproot $image<br>
        rm -rf $tmproot</font><br>
      <font face=3D"Courier New, Courier, monospace">----------------------=
--------<wbr>----------</font><br>
      <br>
      Now everything you want to be in final container need to be stored
      in <font face=3D"Courier New, Courier, monospace">$tmproot/upper/</fo=
nt>,
      by example to add <font face=3D"Courier New, Courier, monospace">/etc=
/foo</font>
      in container:<br>
      <br>
      <font face=3D"Courier New, Courier, monospace">mkdir -p
        $tmproot/upper/etc<br>
        echo &quot;foo&quot; &gt; $tmproot/upper/etc/foo</font><br>
      <br>
      Created files/directories will be owned by user executing the
      script, to set different owner you still need root privileges.<br>
      <br>
      Hope that helps.<br>

        <div>We have been supporting docker and singularity
          containerization to deliver our software. We were using
          persistent overlay on an ext3 img format to create some
          scratch space needed by our software that we did not want to
          expose to the user. A wrapper script would take care of
          mounting user volumes and overlaying the ext3 img over the
          simg in version 2.6.1. No sudo was required for creating the
          writable scratch space.<br>

        <div>With singularity 3.x I could not figure out a way to create

          without root permissions. Is there any possibility to use
          --overlay without sudo or how can I create some scratch space

          something is not clear. I understand that this is not aligned
          with singularity principles of immutable container images, but
          as a software vendor, I need to make sure that some parts of
          the software which are generated at runtime are as hard to
