Oh! And could you give detail about tagging would be useful to you? Right
now we attempt to generate software tags automatically, and leave
documentation to READMEs etc in the github repo. Are you looking to
manually tag your repo with search terms in some way? Or have tags akin to
the way I just described (using different branches?)
