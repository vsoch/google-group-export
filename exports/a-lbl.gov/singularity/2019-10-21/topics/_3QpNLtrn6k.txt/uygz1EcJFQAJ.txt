I appreciate both of your responses. I made the change and had to tweak the 
mkdir to chmod -R since the build process complained that the directory 
already exists. Unfortunately I ran into an issue with the Cloud remote 
build execution complaining about:

FATAL:   Sending file did not succeed: 507 
Upload would exceed quota
FATAL:   While performing build: build image size <= 0

I will need to wait until the guy with sudo privileges gets back and have 
him build locally so we don't have this issue. In the meantime, I will try 
Vanessa's suggestion on the container that was built for me.

Thanks, 

Jack

<br>&gt; Hey Jack,
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; It looks like the software is trying to write temporary checkpoint=

<br>&gt;&gt; singularity run --bind /tmp/checkpoints:/usr/local/<wbr>cuda/c=

<br>&gt; What you won&#39;t be able to do is write (touch or similar) in th=
