Hi Vanessa,

That does make sense.  However I cannot seem to change the port number in t=
he image (although I can change it in the container by running singularity =
with --writable)

=3D=3D=3D Attempt #1 =3D=3D=3D
When I try to run with my dockerfile which has the line:
ADD nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
I find that the file is unchanged from the default.

This is different behavior from docker which would overwrite the default ng=
inx.conf file with the my version via the ADD

=3D=3D=3D Attempt #2 =3D=3D=3D
When I try to run with my dockerfile which has the line:
RUN sed -i 's/Port 80/Port 8080/' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
I find once again that the file is unchanged from the default.

This is different behavior from docker which would overwrite the edit-in-pl=
ace the nginx.conf file with the sed command.

I know the sed command is working because when I shell into the container, =
it works; but I need to make the change in the image, and it doesn't seem t=
o want to allow that!  Can you help?

Cheers, Joel
