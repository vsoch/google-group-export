Actually, sorry, I misunderstood the situation. Propagating /tmp/.X11-unix 
and ~/.Xauthority is necessary for running a DE from a docker container. 
But in Sy, $HOME and /tmp are mounted already so you don't need to bind 
that.

In my test, I can start Xfce from within the container. The panel has 
broken icons but the DE seems functional otherwise. I assume this is what 
you are seeing. My guess is the broken icons can be fixed with a bind to a 
cache directory. I get the same kind of broken icon problem in VBox when 
the VM has no more space.
