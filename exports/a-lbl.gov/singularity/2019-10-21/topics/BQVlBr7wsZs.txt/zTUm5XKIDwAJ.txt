Thanks!!
May I ask if you have included :

Re: [sylabs/singularity] Long command causes "Failed to read JSON
configuration from socket: Bad file descriptor" error (#2428)

In this RC?
We just tested the bug fix and the users reported successful runs !! So it
would be nice if you can include it in v3.0.3

Thanks.
