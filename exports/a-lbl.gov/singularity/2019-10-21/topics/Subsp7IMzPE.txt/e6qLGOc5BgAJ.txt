I recently installed the singularity desktop version for macOS (
https://www.sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/), and ran a small test to 
see if a node server could be run through a container. I downloaded the 
package using the .pkg file supplied in the download link in the article, 
and I was prompted for my password, and it installed correctly. I then 
issued a "singularity pull docker://node" command to pull the latest node 
image from docker. 

I encountered two main "issues" when running the shell using "singularity 
shell node.sif"

1. I was able to make directories and remove directories completely fine, 
but when I attempted to do an "npm install express" command, or something 
similar, the running image refused to write out the necessary items for the 
package. This happened also with the "npm install -g" command, which 
installs to "/usr/local/node_modules." This command did not work also, and 
when attempting to run with sudo, it said that sudo is not an available 
command.

2. I attempted to run a simple hello-world.js node server given the current 
node installation on the image, which was confirmed to be there when I did 
a "which node/npm" command. When the server started, it said that the 
server would be hosted on https://127.0.0.1:3000 (localhost:3000), but upon 
going to localhost:3000 in my browser, the server was not running. 

Are these simply issues with the alpha version of the macOS application, or 
are these actual singularity features? I have only used pre-set up 
singularity instances before, and I am not entirely sure how the process 
works.
