Hi Dr. Dave,

Thanks for the message!  Believe it or not, we are still pretty much on
schedule. 2.5 was really only supposed to contain the fix for the whiteout
files (authored by Dave #3 [or Dave #1 depending on your point of view
=F0=9F=98=8A]).  We are planning a 2.6 release that will include more featu=
res
backported out of development as well as cleaning up some open PRs.  Check
the final section of this post
<https://www.sylabs.io/2018/03/managing-singularity-branches/> for some
info on how the release cycle is supposed to work when we are not fixing
vulnerabilities.

Just a quick note too.  I wouldn't use the number of open issues and PRs as
a measure of how behind we are.  Big projects tend to have lots of issues
and PRs.  For instance K8s currently has around 2.3k open issues and 1k
open PRs.  Some are around a year and a half old.  As Singularity matures,
I would imagine these numbers will grow and not shrink.

Dave (G)
