Subject: Re: [Singularity] several executables packages in the same sapp and callable
From: Karl Forner <karl....@gmail.com>

My use case is as usual to bundle a R distribution with pre-installed
packages and dependency libs to enable reproducible research.

When bundling this R via a SAPP, there will be multiple executables inside,
and IMHO the great thing about singularity is to offer seamless integration.
So I'd like to call the R, Rscript and co executables as if there were
installed on the system, but in fact executing within the SAPP.

I just had an idea that seems neat ;) :
suppose that sapprun starts by analyzing its command-line, in particular
its path.
Then it checks if this path is a symbolic link, and in that case it takes
the filename of the symbolic link as the name of the executable to launch.
e.g.


   - R is a symlink to ./R302.sapp
   - Rscript is alsol a symlink to ./R302.sapp

If I run: ./R -h it will run R from R302.sapp (i.e. echo "R -h" |
singularity shell R302.sapp)

If i run ./Rscript toto.R, it runs echo "Rscript toto.R" | singularity
shell R302.sapp
What do you think ?

Karl
