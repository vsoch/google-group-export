I advocate for Docker Hub because it is a means of getting images via
layers. Even using docker2singularity requires the dependency of Docker
installed, but Singularity --> Docker Hub does not, it uses a restful API.
If you want to use layers without either of those things, then you can find
them on your computer and import. But then you also need to issue commands
to obtain the environment and other container metadata.

If you have a suggestion for a workflow that you would prefer other than
building on Docker Hub, issuing singularity pull docker://ubuntu, (without
needing Docker installed) and then having a working container, please share
and we can chat about it.

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 fi
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; done
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; so you don&#39;t have the environment variables because they a=
ren&#39;t being
<br>&gt;&gt; sourced. The option with -e would clean the environment from y=
our host, not
<br>&gt;&gt; what is in the container. Here is where some of this happens, =
if it helps.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; I think if you want this to work as expected, you should put y=
our docker
<br>&gt;&gt; image on docker hub, and then bootstrap appropriately:
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; singularity create image.img
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; sudo singularity bootstrap image.img Singularity
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; This will handle the Docker environment to coincide with the c=
urrent
<br>&gt;&gt; implementation that sources it. Give that a go and see if it h=
elps.

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Luca,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you convert from Docker, Singularity =
will automatically grab the
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ENV variables that you&#39;ve defined, so =
you shouldn&#39;t need to specify it
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice. Which of the two are you wanting to=
 not use? You can easily remove
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the extra specification from %environment.=
 If you want to disable
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; singularity adding, we don&#39;t have any =
kind of flag for that (but it could be
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily added).
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
