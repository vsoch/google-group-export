I'm unable to keep up at present, but I saw this go by.

Doubtless it won't go down well, but from the state of the source I last
checked, I think it needs plenty of work before it's released.  In
particular, I don't consider it releasable for Fedora (though the
automated system unfortunately pushed it into f24).

sexec is setuid but doesn't check many return codes correctly and has
other problems.  The "flawfinder: ignore" noise actually suppresses real
issues flawfinder suggests and other changes that seem to have been
occasioned by flawfinder seem to have made it less correct.  I don't
know whether any of that is exploitable, but the question shouldn't
arise.

I have potential fixes for a lot of it, but they need proper
checking/review.

[There are potentially better checking tools, but splint won't cope with
c99, cpachecker crashes, I don't know how to drive frama-c usefully, and
I haven't tried rose/compass (which I wish didn't use proprietary
parsers).  However, I found two classes of error with gcc.]
