C becomes a part of each linux distribution. Docker since 1.11 uses runC as=
 a backend. And runC is a standard since last Summer. Although for now runc=
 is not a part of each linux distro, I have feeling it will be. So I wonder=
 if you, Gregory, is thinking about using runC as a backend keeping all the=
 current Singularity features.

Of course that not an issue if your are running a recent linux distribution=
, but what<br>
will happen in a few years when golang and runC move forward?<br>
<br>
OTOH, I just need a basic environment and I can build singularity on all my=
<br>
platforms, (CentOS-5 CentOS-6 and now CentOS-7) the idea is being able to u=
se<br>
singularity to allow the newer distribution to run the older binaries witho=

singularity might give me N-&gt;N+2 or more without too much effort (ie by<=
br>
packaging and not recompiling).<br>
<br>
<br>
With singularity I gain a backward compatibility for free: a CentOS-6 (glib=
c<br>
2.12) getconf running on CentOS-5 is neat:<br>
[tru@sillage singularity]$ rpm -q glibc<br>

<br>
Fair enough, retro compatibility has limits!<br>
