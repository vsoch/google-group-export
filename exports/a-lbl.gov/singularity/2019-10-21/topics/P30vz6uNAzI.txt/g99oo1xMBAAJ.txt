Almost! A collection can have as many containers as you like, the recipes
are discovered via the extension of the Singularity file, which corresponds
to a tag. It doesn't matter where in the repository you have them. So for
example, this (for username vsoch):

    repo/
>        Singularity
>        folder/
>            Singularity.awesome


would build containers:

 shub://vsoch/repo:latest
>  shub://vsoch/repo:awesome


And it also expects that each def file will be named "Singularity".

Only the prefix (first part). We do this so that Singularity Hub doesn't
need to store any "special information" For example, on Docker Hub you can
define custom Dockerfile names / paths, but if the database was lost? You
would lose that information. With Shub, if we lose that information, the
Singularity.* files preserve this. I try to be as flexible to allow the
user to have multiple recipes, named differently, without losing enough
structure to be reproducible and make the recipes discoverable without much
effort.

I'm proposing an alternate idea, where a GitHub repo has a directory at the
top level, (maybe called /.singularity or /.remotebuilder or something) and
there is one or a series of conf files in that directory (maybe .yaml or
.toml files or something) that specify which files in the repo are are def
files, which files need to be copied up to the remote builder, etc.  Maybe
there is also configuration for the type of hardware you need to build on.
Don't know.  Thoughts?  Ideas?

This would definitely be another option! It does smell a bit more like
traditional continuous integration, but just with another kind of yaml that
various services would need to know how to parse. If you set it up with
Travis or Circle or similar, for example, you'd have two yaml's to parse.
The yaml camel may not think so, but some might think that there is such a
thing as too many yamls :)

Would love to see a proof of concept and an example repo for users to clone
and then run their builds! We can add to singularity-ci when it's ready.

Best,

V
