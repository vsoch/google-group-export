Hi Vanessa,
I can't speak to Jai;'s use case, but I'd like to try to put a linux
desktop environement (vnc server, window manager etc) in a container, allow
people to start a vnc server and use the menus to launch subsequent
containers (neuroimaging workflows come to mind, but really any container)

I'm unclear as to how this works, unless there is more magic in the more
recent singularity releases than I realised, wouldn't bind mounting the
image drop the SUID bits on the singularity executable within the container=
?

Cheers,
--
Chris.

<br>The crucial general point of comparison from my point of view is how th=
