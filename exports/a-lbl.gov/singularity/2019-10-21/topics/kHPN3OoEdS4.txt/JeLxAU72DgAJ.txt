Hi Thomas,

Could you give more detail about how you installed singularity? It may not
be exactly in /etc/. For example, if you install with --prefix /usr/local

$ which singularity
/usr/local/bin/singularity
$ ls /usr/local/etc/singularity/
default-nsswitch.conf  init  singularity.conf

It should be the case that the current master produces that file in the
/etc directory with the same install base.  If this is not the case for
you, could you please share how you installed singularity, and then show
what you see? If the error can be reproduced, it will be easier to help!

What are your goals for wanting to change singularity.conf? Generally, you
shouldn't need to interact with it - it's what a superuser person / admin
would configure to install singularity on his or her cluster. To do simple
stuff like bootstrapping, (the link from the tutorial you included) you
don't need to work with the conf. Could you share what you are trying to do?

I just tested your spec file - and I think the error is that you have some
characters that singularity seems to be doing weird things with. I used
dos2unix on the file and it started the bootstrap process appropriately
(which didn't work for me originally). I'm attaching the fixed file, but be
careful about opening it in editors and whatnot that might make it broken
again. Maybe you could try pushing to a Github repo and building on Singularity
Hub <http://www.singularity-hub.org> instead?

Best,

Vanessa
