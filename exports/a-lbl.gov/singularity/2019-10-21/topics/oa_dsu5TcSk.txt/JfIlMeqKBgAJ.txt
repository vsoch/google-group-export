This may be more of a question for the Biocontainers folks (hopefully some 
are watching), but perhaps someone else has seen this problem and has a 
workaround.

We rely on Biocontainers for some bio packages. I do admit that we steer 
people to use udocker because of its simplicity, but, running biocontainers 
with singularity has worked as late as last August, by doing something like:
$ singularity shell docker://biocontainers/blast

Now we get this:
$ singularity shell docker://biocontainers/blast
FATAL:   Unable to handle docker://biocontainers/blast uri: failed to get 
SHA of docker://biocontainers/blast: Error reading manifest latest in 
docker.io/biocontainers/blast: manifest unknown: manifest unknown

AFAIK, Biocontainers are hosted at quay.io. How can I tell Singularity to 
query that registry instead of docker.io? I don't seem to find this 
information (if it's possible) in the documentation. 

Though, on the other hand, since the containers were found before the 
registry may not be an issue (I am using Singularity 2.5 for both in August 
and now, though the error also happens in 3.0.1).

We have tested ~650 biocontainers now and out of them only 8 succeeded, the 
rest giving the error above.

Any pointer would be appreciated.

Martin
