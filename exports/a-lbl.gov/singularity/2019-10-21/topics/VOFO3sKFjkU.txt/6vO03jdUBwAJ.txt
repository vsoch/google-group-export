Hi,

FYI Karl:

Note that you should take care about Rscript, because when you build R from
source or when you install it from a package, this binary contains the R
install path ! You cannot easily move it or create packages for it, even
modules are not working here.

It works great for basic R (/usr/bin/R contains the R_HOME_DIR) command,
not Rscript. Changing the R_HOME environment variable does not change
anything. I do not know actually how the main R package maintainer are
doing to bypass this issue.

You can check by doing:
hexdump -C /usr/bin/Rscript |grep '/R'

Keep me inform if you are able to make it works under a singularity sapp.

Best,

Remy
