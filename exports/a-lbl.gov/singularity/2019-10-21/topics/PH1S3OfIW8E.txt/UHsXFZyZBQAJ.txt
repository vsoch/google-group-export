Hi Ayrio,

There are a lot of possibilities on why the user is non-existant inside
your container (e.g. how you imported your Docker container into the
Singularity image) which we would need a lot more information in order to
help you debug.

But, it is important to note that while what you are doing Singularity can
technically do (e.g. going from root user to a non-root user), that is not
a generally applicable workflow as it requires root privileges and is
generally not portable. A more Singularity applicable usage would be to
launch the container as a non-root user (unless you are trying to spawn a
daemon process).

Hope that helps!

Greg
