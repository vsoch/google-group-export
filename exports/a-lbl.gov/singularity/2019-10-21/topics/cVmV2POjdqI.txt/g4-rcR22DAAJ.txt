I found the solution. Didn't realise that cp -r would not honour all chmod 
bits (what is the technical term for this again?)

So to solve this, I did the following:

cd /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin
chmod u+s starter-suid

And it works!

I will amend the write-up and use something like rsync to more accurately 
copy the artefacts to the host.
