I had a similar question about a month ago that we didn't quite get figured 
out:

https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/d/topic/singularity/IGvUup1aGXE/discussion

 -- a job running within a singularity container that passes an sbatch 
command (similar to qsub) to the "global" scheduler.  It has to do with the 
container interacting with its "global" environment -- we can mount files 
within the container, but haven't figure out how to submit them.

I think one of the issues that came up is how it might be bad practice for 
portable code but, in our case, we don't necessarily care about sharing the 
container with someone else -- our HPC REQUIRES we use singularity, but we 
need to have a singularity container create jobs and then submit them.  In 
my case, what I end up doing is having the container build the jobs, but 
then I have to manually (in the "outside" environment) submit them.

I think the basic request is allowing a container to execute something 
(anything) in the "containing" environment as if the user was typing it on 
the command line in that environment.
