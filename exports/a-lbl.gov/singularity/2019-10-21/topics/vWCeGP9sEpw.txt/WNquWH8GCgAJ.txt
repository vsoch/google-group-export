I can't speak to SLURM leaving zombie processes lying around.  That is
unusual.  Perhaps it has to do with what you are running inside the
container?  Are you using a new PID namespace when you run singularity?

SLURM should track memory of the actual job.  Which includes the
singularity process itself and any processes running inside of the
container.  The problem you are noting with sacct is a problem with SLURM
generally.  SLURM logging is not instantaneous.  Sometimes you have a job
that starts ramping up memory usage very quickly.  Then it gets killed by
SLURM before proper logging occurs and you don't see the actual amount of
memory that was used in sacct.  In these conditions it's usually best to
submit a representative test job with much more memory than you think it
will actually need.  Then record how much memory the job used and update
your memory allocation for future jobs accordingly.

The SLURM config should be just fine to support Singularity.  Singularity
is just another app!  Albeit a really awesome one.
