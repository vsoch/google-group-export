Hi Oriol,

there are several in fact:

(slc)Thomas.Maier@gar-ws-etp07:~>env | grep SINGULARITY
SINGULARITY_libexecdir=/usr/local/libexec
SINGULARITY_localstatedir=/usr/local/var
SINGULARITY_INIT=1
SINGULARITY_sysconfdir=/etc
SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=cern-slc6-05.05.2017.img
SINGULARITY_IMAGE=/project/etp3/ThomasMaier/Singularity/versions/cern-slc6-05.05.2017.img


I'm still using version 2.2.1, so it might look a bit different for newer 
version, but in general variables beginning with "SINGULARITY" are set by 
singularity when opening a shell or executing a command within the 
singularity image (assuming you haven't set it yourself, of course). You 
might want to check yourself what you get when you're inside the 
singularity image or running 'singularity exec'.

If one of the devs has a good recommendation for what to use, they can 
comment as well of course :).

Cheers

Thomas
