Hey Alan, be careful with this as it can crash UGE's DRMAA2 implementation=
=20
even though Daniel works for Univa. Even a simple hello world can wreak=20
havoc on the scheduler at least it did on ours. I haven't tried it again=20
for a while, but watch the DRMAA2 connections closely. Had zero issues with=
=20
DRMAA1.
