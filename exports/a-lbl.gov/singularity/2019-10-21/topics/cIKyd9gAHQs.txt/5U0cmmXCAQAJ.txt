Subject: Re: [Singularity] Symlink on /tmp in %post section issue
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hi Jafaruddin,
I think if you don't have much space in /tmp, you could create a
directory, let's say singularity,
in your /mnt and then export the environment variable
SINGULARITY_TMPDIR="/mnt/singularity".
No need for simlinks or soever, the temorary build will be done in
/mnt/singularity.

Cheers,
