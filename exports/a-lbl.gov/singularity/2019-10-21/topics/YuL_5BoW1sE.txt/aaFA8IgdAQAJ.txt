Hi Igor,

  You don't *need* to have --localstatedir on the node, but we
recommend that you have that local to each node where Singularity is
running. That structure is used when mounting an image, and each mount
should be in its own mount namespace.

  IIRC, there isn't really any "space" used. It's the mount point for
the loop devices. So for example, /dev/loop2 would be mounted at (for
example) $localstatedir/singularity/mnt/container. If there is space
used, it should be minor in comparison to the image size itself.

  Someone will need to speak up if I'm totally off on my understanding
here though, but from what I understand the reasoning is mostly
consistency, and to have where the image gets mounted local to the
machine where it's running. So, our recommendation is to have
--localstatedir being a location that is local to the node.
