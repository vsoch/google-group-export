Hi Vanessa!

Funnily enough, right when you sent this email I was in a discussion with
Christian Kniep about just this! (rest of the comments inline)

Looks very cool! Thank you!

This came up specifically with my talk with Christian. He thinks that it
may be possible to determine the Dockerfile CMD from within the Docker
container root. I have not had a chance to investigate this, but it would
indeed be very interesting if we could and then import it directly into a
Singularity runscript (/singularity).

That would also be very helpful for the image repo!

That is an excellent idea. Can you create a GitHub issue/enhancement for
this and include your ideas on what kind of information you want to store,
and perhaps how you want to set and edit that info? Chances are it will go
into 2.2 (instead of 2.1 which I am just finishing up on).

Oh, thank you for telling me about the GitHub limitations! I am open to
suggestions on where and how to host the images.

Thank you and have a safe trip!
