Hi Vanessa,

I finally had some time to look into this earlier today.  Per your 
suggestion, I tried creating a container as myself, no luck: 

[itoufiqu@compute-7-2 ~]$ singularity -v create --size 30000 
/tmp/debian_jessie_tvb.img
Increasing verbosity level (2)
Singularity version: 2.3.1-dist
Exec'ing: /data/apps/singularity/2.3.1/libexec/singularity/cli/create.exec
VERBOSE: Set messagelevel to: 2
VERBOSE: Initialize configuration file: 
/data/apps/singularity/2.3.1/etc/singularity/singularity.conf
VERBOSE: Initializing Singularity Registry
ERROR  : Singularity is not running with appropriate privileges!
ERROR  : Check installation path is not mounted with 'nosuid', and/or 
consult manual.
ABORT  : Retval = 255

[itoufiqu@compute-7-2 ~]$ whoami
itoufiqu


singularity was installed as 'root' .  Below is the config file: 

allow setuid = yes
max loop devices = 256
config passwd = yes
config group = yes
config resolv_conf = yes
mount proc = yes
mount sys = yes
mount dev = yes
mount home = yes
mount tmp = yes
mount hostfs = no
bind path = /etc/localtime
bind path = /etc/hosts
bind path = /dfs1
bind path = /dfs2
bind path = /data
user bind control = yes
enable overlay = yes
mount slave = yes
sessiondir max size = 16

What do I need to do get this fixed, please?

thanks.
