Hi Gregory,

Thanks for your thorough answer.

ok I understand.
What happens if from the sapp running R, you run an Sapp executable
installed on the host ?
e.g. from the eclipse Sapp, you execute the R from the R sapp ?

Not exactly, since we do not need the result in the Sapp, meaning that we
do not need the process (libreoffice) to execute in the sapp namespace.
We just want the sapp to trigger/delegate the opening of the file on the
host.

Hmm in practice what I would like to do is double-click on a file within
eclipse running in the sapp and have it opened on the host.
So the eclipse is already running via singularity.
Maybe I don't get it, but your example is run from the host, not the sapp.

It was rather: if we have two separate sapps, one for R, and one for
eclipse/statET, is-it possible to somewhat link the two sapps so that
eclipse within the Sapp can use the R for the R sapp.
