Dave,

Thanks so much for your response. I ended up asking our Admin to install 
Singularity locally on all the cluster compute nodes (and as root) to avoid 
the NFS issue I referenced previously and that resolved this problem. It's 
good to know this might not be necessary for EL7.4 (I'll let our Admin 
know).

Thanks!
Sandeep
