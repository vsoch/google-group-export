----
Singularity 2.2.1 Security Release:

This release includes a fix for a Moderate Severity security issue, and
other improvements to version 2.2.

Security information:

In versions of Singularity previous to 2.2.1, it was possible for a
malicious user to create and manipulate specifically crafted raw devices
within containers they own. Utilizing MS_NODEV as a container image mount
option mitigates this potential vector of attack. As a result, this update
should be implemented with high urgency. A big thanks to Mattias Wadenstein
(@UMU in Sweden) for identifying and reporting this issue!

Other improvements:

* Fixed some leaky file descriptors
* Cleaned up *printf() usage
* Catch if user's group is not properly defined

Please report any additional bugs to:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/new

Thank you!
