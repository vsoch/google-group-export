Hi Oliver, et. al.,

Yes, you are exactly right! It's been really hard trying to maintain
support for these legacy kernels, and with this latest find, we just
decided let's focus on moving forward.

The file system mounting issue has been on our radar since day one, but it
has always been a functionality trade off. At some point we may write our
own alternative solution, but that is still a ways out. Shorter term, we
have been debating how to further mitigate and we have some interesting
solutions:

First:
In v3, the Singularity Image Format (SIF) image can be cryptograhically
signed. We can only trust and used signed containers. Couple that with a
thumbs up/down mechanism on the Container Library side and a key management
platform, ... At runtime we could potentially check to see if a container
is "trusted" to run.

Second:
We will also have a container builder (
https://www.sylabs.io/2018/04/sylabs-remote-build-service/) which can be
used in conjunction with a "trusted location" or "trusted signature" and
Singularity can be configured to only trust SIF containers coming from that
location.

Both of these features are coming in our development of Singularity v3 and
additional cloud services.

Last point I want to make is that the Sylabs team has grown quite a bit. We
have over a dozen developers working full time on Singularity and
Singularity related services. I am looking forward to sharing more of what
we are prototyping! Also, remember to check out our "Lab Notes" which is a
weekly update from the developers:

https://www.sylabs.io/lab-notes/

Thank you!

<br>
many thanks for the heads-up!<br>
<br>
A few questions inline... <br>
<br>
Am 24.04.2018 um 02:03 schrieb Dave Godlove:<br>
</span>&gt; Greetings Singularity users,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
<span>&gt; The Singularity team has been working to support older legacy ke=
rnels that do not instantiate the prctlfunction PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS.=C2=A0 =
Starting in version 2.5, Sylabs is giving up on that fight and outdated ker=
nels will no longer be supported. =C2=A0<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We, at Sylabs, recently discovered an exploit vector to all container =
runtimes which allows a malicious user to gain additional privileges within=
 a container on hosts that do not support the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVSfeature.<b=
r>
<br>
Does this statement also hold for container runtimes using user namespaces =
only? <br>
Is there a CVE? <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
</span>&gt; The PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVSfeature was added to prctl()in the Linux=
 3.5 kernel. Various distributions have since backported this feature to cu=
rrently maintained kernels (for example, Red Hat added this feature to RHEL=
 6.7 with the 2.6.32-504.16.2kernel). The most effective way to determine i=
f your system is affected by this issue is to test the support directly.=C2=
=A0 As a convenience Sylabs provides a script to allow you to do that autom=
atically via the following command:<br>
<span>&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; curl -s <a href=3D"https://www.sylabs.io/privtest/no_new_privs.sh" rel=
=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.sylabs.io/privtest<wbr>/no_ne=
w_privs.sh</a> | bash<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
</span><span>&gt; If you find that your system does not properly support th=
is feature, you will need to either upgrade the operating system, upgrade t=
he kernel, or disable Singularity (set allow setuid =3D noin singularity.co=
nffile) and/or any other container runtime you may have installed pending a=
 kernel update.<br>
<br>
How does setting &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; &quot;disable Singularity&=
quot;? <br>
Again: If this is only affecting container runtimes needing setuid root, wh=
y should I disable others (e.g. charliecloud, runc&#39;s rootless container=
s,...)? <br>
How is PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS of any effect if there are no special privileges=
 involved? <br>
<br>
AFAIK, &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; for Singularity only disables the se=
tuid root based functionality, which many users actually do not need - last=
 time I checked it was only needed for OverlayFS and image file mounting,<b=
r>
which is to be considered unsafe anyways at least for a few years to follow=
 unless the container image source is fully trusted. &quot;limit container =
paths&quot;, or just not using image files since they are not so efficientl=
y distributed anyways,<br>
are very helpful here. <br>
See for example <a href=3D"http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1804.0=
/02163.html" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http://lkml.iu.edu/hyperm=
ail/l<wbr>inux/kernel/1804.0/02163.html</a> which clearly states the opinio=
n of the expert in the field concerning the security implications of mounti=
ng image files. <br>
<br>
Still, many thanks for the heads-up, but some more detailed information alo=
ng the lines of:<br>
- who exactly is affected (it&#39;s unclear if this only affects setuid roo=
t users, and if so, it surely affects only a small subset of available othe=
r container runtimes!) <br>
- how to mitigate until one can upgrade (again, you state &quot;disable Sin=
gularity&quot; and &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; which are two completely=
 different things to my knowledge) <br>
- CVE / background info links, if available, would have been nice. <br>
- which versions of singularity are affected in which configurations? <br>
<br>
Or, in short, just see the mail from Dave (Dykstra) at 2018-04-07 18:21 on =
this very list asking for this (usually customary) information. <br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
