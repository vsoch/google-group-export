Hey Matt,

Does building on Singularity Hub help anywhere in that workflow?

http://singularity-hub.org

You would basically:

 - add the recipe for your container to a Github repo
 - connect the repo to Singularity Hub
 - it builds on commit, manual, or deployment status
 - pull to your resource.

If you use the updated singularity-builder-2.5-100mb (note you have to
select this in settings, I haven't made the default yet) you get a larger
instance with more CPU. If the image itself is too big, then you could try
deploying your own singularity registry to serve containers for your
institution --> https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry OR a cloud
builder --> https://singularityhub.github.io/builders/ . Sylabs also has
announced a remote build service you should check out! Let me know if you
want any help with the open source options listed, I think among all the
great options we can definitely find a good solution. And welcome to the
community and singularity container world! :D

Best,

Vanessa
