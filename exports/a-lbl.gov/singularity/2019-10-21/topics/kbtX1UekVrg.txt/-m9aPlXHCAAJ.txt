I don't think that's always the case; I would bet that there are
exceptions to that.  The project I am most familiar with is squid, and
they don't have LTS branches.  They support security updates for older
versions for a while after major upgrades, but mostly new releases come
to the latest stable version (and newer unstable versions if there is
one).  They always say which versions are impacted in a security
announcement.

I don't think it necessarily needs to be that strong, based on the Q&A
you link below (more details on that point below).  The singularity
security policy at=20
    https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/security-policy/
already says they will always get a CVE for a vulnerability, and it
doesn't say that doesn't apply to older releases, so assume it does
apply.  It also says that they will say in the announcement which
releases are affected.  How about if they further say that they will
provide a patch for older versions if it is easy, but not promise to
create a new release based on non-current open source versions?  I know
that squid has sometimes provided security patches for older versions
without making a new release.

Singularity team & Sylabs: are you willing to amend your security policy
to say that if the latest version is not vulnerable that you'll at least
provide a source code patch for the newest vulnerable release, if the
patch is small?

That clearly allows for exceptions.  It says
    In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for
    example when large amounts of source code need to be modified or
    rewritten. If that happens it might be necessary to move to a new
    upstream version, but this has to be coordinated with the security
    team beforehand.
That sounds quite a lot like what the singularity security policy is
saying.  If they develop a fix for the latest release, and it would be
hard to do it for an older release, they could just recommend that
everyone upgrade to the latest version.  If the Debian package provider
also thinks it is too much work to backport, he or she would need to ask
the Debian security team for an exception, and if they agreed it is too
hard they would grant it.

The Debian Q&A also says it is most important to maintain stability for
library APIs, which is not an issue with this package.

Yes it would be quite a burden on users to ask them to get singularity
only from Unstable.  firefox doesn't sound like a good example because
there is firefox-esr.

This is a clear difference between the Debian and Fedora/EPEL/CentOS
communities, and I think it is unfortunate.  Some packages that are in
Fedora stay in EPEL forever and never make it to RHEL/CentOS.  I think
it would be good to have some mechanism for similar packages in Debian.

Please do.  Talk specifically about the situation for 3.x only. I don't
think there should be expectations for continued security support for
2.x for very long because of the difficulty of backporting fixes.
Backports between different 3.x levels when a security fix comes in a
new 3.x.y release should be much easier at that point in general because
of the common language.  Of course this means that Debian packaging for
3.x needs to get completed first.
