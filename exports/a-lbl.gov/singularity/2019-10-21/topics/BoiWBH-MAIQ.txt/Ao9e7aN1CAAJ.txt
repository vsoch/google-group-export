HI Chris,

I can tell you that this is absolutely doable (without the need for suid 
binaries).  I've done almost exactly what you describe (only using ThinLinc 
<https://www.cendio.com/>rather than X2Go.  I had Nvidia GRID K2 cards in 
the servers with an X server running on the bare metal, configured with a 
separate display for each GPU.  I also had  VirtualGL installed and 
configured on the bare metal machine.  I installed the ThinLinc agent on 
both the bare metal and in the containers.  I did have some issues with 
Xvnc in the container communicating with the Xserver initially, and if I 
recall correctly, it was something to do with dbus communication, and it 
was just a mater of mounting a certain directory within the container 
(sorry for the lack of specifics, but I retired and no longer have access 
to the systems that I set this up on).

The system I setup was running Centos7 desktops with accelerated graphics 
on Ubuntu 14.04 hosts.  

Ron
