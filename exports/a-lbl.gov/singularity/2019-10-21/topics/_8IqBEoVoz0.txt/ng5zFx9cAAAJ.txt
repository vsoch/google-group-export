A very quick comment.
On non-containerised clusters it is common to install different versions of
an application 'fancyname' (*) such that you would have
/apps/foo/fancyname/11.0
/apps/foo/fancyname/12.0

then  maybe put a link in to the current version  /apps/foo/current -->
/apps/foo/12.0
(and of course there is the software modules environment which can take
care of loading these versions into your path)
I am thinking of Abaqus here, which installs itself into a numbered
directory like that, and there are many more.
I guess this does not conflict with the SCI-F proposal, as you can always
(in my experience) give the root directory to the install script.


With containers of course you would not install multiple versions of
fancyname - you would have a different container for different versions.
So you would have /apps/foo/fancyname/12.0


(*) I now have a burning desire to start a Github project called fancyname
