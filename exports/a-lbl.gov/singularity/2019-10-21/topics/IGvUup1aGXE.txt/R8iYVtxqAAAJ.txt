Hi Thomas,

Yes. I think what you've described would be the next thing to try. It would 
probably be the approach to take to run host commands generally. Though, it 
also moves one further from the write-once-run-anywhere ideal.

I'll probably abandon attempts to call the host's scheduler from within the 
container. I'll still need to call the host's mpirun from within the 
container.

Jason
