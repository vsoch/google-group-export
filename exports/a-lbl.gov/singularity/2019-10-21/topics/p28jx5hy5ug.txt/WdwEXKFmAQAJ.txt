Igor,

Let me try to answer you but if I'm incorrect or missing any points Greg or
others please chime in.

With Singularity CPU are seen inside the container exactly as on the host.
So if you install special RPMs and tools to make use of CPU specialities
you will have to make sure you install similar packages and tools inside
the container OS to take advantage of those CPU specialities.

That said I'm just curious on which features of using containers are you
going for ? If you are anyways going to compile your application on the
server you might as well do it on the bare metal instead of maintaining
multiple container stacks.

Hope this helps,
--Krishna.
