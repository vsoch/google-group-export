Hi Oliver and Thomas,

SIF organizes various piece of data pertaining to a container inside a
file. This file system image can be used directly by the SIF tools and
libraries at runtime or by mapping the image to the file system if desired.
It is also possible to explode the content of a SIF image into directories
and files if necessary. We are currently expanding our SIF manipulation
tool to that effect. Also like Dave T. already suggested, sandboxes can
still be used where they make better sense. In other words, plenty of
choice. We believe that the SIF container format will help with the
majority of use cases where simplicity around mobility but also access to
features like signing/verification and the storage of various data and
meta-data related to the container is wanted.

For the case of encryption, this is of course an optional feature. I
foresee encryption being used mostly in environments where users have
direct control over how their data and files are managed. Once again, even
though SIF's attempt is to simply be a file system designed for containers
opening up a lot of possibilities, there may be cases where mapping its
content via FUSE to the file system is more useful. Encryption is on our
roadmap and there's still efforts required to get it out there. If you have
any insights on how you would see it all working nicely, we'd be glad to
start a thread on that :-)

Thomas, I am not sure what you mean by single image versus (chunks), but if
it helps, a SIF file has a file system structure with a global header, data
object descriptors (like inodes), and data blocks pointed to by those data
object descriptors. Data objects inside a SIF file are completely
independent and can be dumped individually by using the "sif dump
<desc_id>" command. Note that you can also, at any time during the
container lifetime add, remove, sign, verify list and get info for those
data objects independently or by group. Yes data blocks are aligned to
values that make sense. They may be page aligned or sector aligned but this
is configurable.

Cheers,

 - Yannick

<br>thanks for the heads-up!=20
<br>What&#39;s still unclear to me, though: Will Singularity still keep san=
dbox-support functional in the new series? There are many users of it, espe=
cially all CVMFS users.=20
<br>Especially for them, SIF does not really increase mobility - if encrypt=
ion is not required, and the FS is trusted and ensures the container is not=
 modified, sandbox containers are more mobile.=20
<br>Of course, SIF is ideal for many other usecases.=20
<br>
<br>Also, with good encryption, things like casync will naturally stop work=
ing. Is there anything planned already on how to transfer deltas in the enc=
rypted and compressed &quot;SIF world&quot;?=20
<br>This would have to happen e.g. by reimplementing content-defined-chunki=
ng e.g. by leveraging casync / zsync at both ends.=20
<br>

<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Hi Oliver,
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 in principle, yes, if you also set LD_=
LIBRARY_PATH etc., but in the end this somehow defeats the container concep=
t.
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Also, you may run into ugly issues if =
stuff from the &quot;real&quot; OS takes over, for example to load dynamic =
libraries, and you get funny incompatibilities.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I am looking for a way to run singularity container =
like environment on systems where sysadmins are resisting installing singul=
arity. In particular I need to run some deep learning code on OpenScience G=
rid and as far as I heard not all sites with GPUs there have singularity.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 So I&#39;d advice against it - but you=
r mileage may vary.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 However, you can also have Singularity=
 run unprivileged, i.e. ship it on a shared filesystem, if you can live wit=
hout the setuid root functionality (e.g. OverlayFS),
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 and your kernel is modern enough to su=
pport user namespaces and has them enabled. In that case, you can use Singu=
larity without &quot;installing&quot; it.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 How do I do it? Do I just build singularity and inst=
all it on a user account? Would --nv GPU feature work?
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 If you really *need* to do it, and you=
r kernel is modern enough, then you might also get away with alternatives s=
uch as runc or charliecloud, especially charliecloud is designed for this w=
ay of operation.
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 They can run a sandbox image which was=
 build with Singularity, unprivileged, if the kernel has user namespace sup=
port enabled.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 How can I find out if the kernel has such a support?
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Without further treatment, however, yo=
u will lose some Singularity features, for example the RUN script, and Sing=
ularity&#39;s environment handling.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 The main feature I would hate to lose is --nv. Unpac=
king different versions of NVIDIA drivers into container the old way is so =
annoying...
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Another alternative, if you&#39;re ope=
n to other Linux distros, is for example to use Gentoo Prefix. Gentoo Prefi=
x ( <a href=3D"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix" rel=3D"nofollow=
" target=3D"_blank">https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/P<wbr>roject:Prefix</a> &l=
t;<a href=3D"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix" rel=3D"nofollow" =
target=3D"_blank">https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/<wbr>Project:Prefix</a>&gt; =
) can run unprivileged
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 in almost any Linux / Unix environment=
 on almost any architecture without use of container technology.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Wow! With this, what is the advantage or disadvantag=
e of containers? Will Gentoo installed on a user account under Linux be abl=
e to use GPU? OpenMP? MPI? Must one install NVIDIA drivers inside Prefix or=
 it can use the ones from the host? Is Gentoo installed on one Linux portab=
le to another linux by rsync or one has to install it from scratch on each =
system?
