OK - some progress.

When I changed the spec file Exec: line from:

Exec: ./tacg
to the full path:
Exec: /home/hjm/tacg/tacg

it was able to exec the spec file to the point where it got an error 
message from the wrapped  tacg application:

$ /home/hjm/tacg/tacg.sapp -h
!!tempfile creation failed - que??

this implies that it failed on the C code:

tmpfp = tmpfile();

do you have to explicitly include /tmp in the spec file to access the /tmp 
dir?
Hmm, doesn't look like it.

$ singularity build tacg.sspec tacg.sapp
...
Installing dir: /tmp
cp: cannot access '/tmp/kde-guest': Permission denied
cp: cannot open '/tmp/foomatic-ui1jpB' for reading: Permission denied
cp: cannot copy a directory, '/tmp', into itself, 
'/tmp/.singularity.YKFUSJb/c/tmp'
Error: failed processing file: 
ERROR: Module install_files threw an error

so why would a fairly common function call cause this failure?
