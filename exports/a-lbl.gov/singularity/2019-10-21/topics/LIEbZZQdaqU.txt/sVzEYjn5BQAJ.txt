Yes,

that has fixed the long string issue, I'll update when the build gets there 
on the second issue.

I made a mistake of pointing to the master development branch as described 
at http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux - I'll need to update our 
documentation to point to the stable releases as this has caused issues 
with a few users. Do I understand it right that from version 2.3 the latest 
stable version will be pointing to 
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git? If so, that would be 
helpful as we would not need to modify our documentation when Singularity 
version changes.

I have one more unrelated question - related to Singularity Hub, if I may?
I have an image of a genomic toolset that I have built for an user that I 
think would be worth sharing, but, the container includes some databases so 
it's >10GB big. Not wanting to waste much space on the Singularity hub, 
would it be appropriate for posting there, or, rather just keep the 
definition file on github?

Thanks,
MC
