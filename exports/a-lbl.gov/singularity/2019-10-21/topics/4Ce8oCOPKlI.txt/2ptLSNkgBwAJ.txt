Hi Victor,

Singularity 3.0.3, I've installed the infiniband drivers inside the
container and strace is showing they are being found. It is likely the
infiniband libraries inside the container are not exactly the same version
as on the system. At the point I'm getting this error I've not yet touched
MPI, I'm still just trying to get the infiniband tools working (i.e.
ibv_devinfo which should just print out the details information about the
infiniband devices I have in the system). ibstat does work, so the
container can see the infiniband device is there, but it cannot access it
to get detailed information (which I can do outside the container).

Thanks, I'll try your recipe and see if works better than the container
I've built.

I h ave been through that github issue but it didn't seem to help my issues=
.

Thanks for the reply.

cheers

adrianj
