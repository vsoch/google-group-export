I agree that container recipes are a laudable goal, but they are an
end-product and not a good mechanism for figuring out what needs to go
in the container.

Our scenario was to make copy the desired application into the
container, then figure out which libraries and subsidiary programs
were finally needed.  I think Robin is spot on -- it would lead to a
frustrating, time-consuming 'development' cycle and would discourage
use more than encourage it.

I think there's a very good balance now between being able to use all
the existing Docker stuff and being able to make a very lean container
from scratch without ever having to touch Doker.
