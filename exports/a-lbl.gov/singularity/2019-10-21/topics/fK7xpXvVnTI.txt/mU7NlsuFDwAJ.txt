The fact that there will be bind mounts occurring in there doesn't bother y=
ou though? Seeing users home directories showing up in /proc/mounts gives m=
e the creeps, but I guess I should be able to fix that with another namespa=
ce separation. Lol

Also I'm kinda a file system hierarchy standards snob, and /var just seems =
to make more sense for this purpose. But everyone I've asked so far seems t=
o prefer the users home directory so maybe I'm just over thinking it.=20

Thanks!!=20
