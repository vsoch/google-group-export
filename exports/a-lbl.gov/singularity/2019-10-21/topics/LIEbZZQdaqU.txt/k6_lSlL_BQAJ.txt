Hi Martin,

Build on the Hub! If you get build errors about the instance size, click
the button in the collection to edit the builder, and increase the size of
the builder. I would suggest being conservative about the builds that you
keep - for example if you build an image and then fix something (and the
previous version is no longer useful) please remove it. Other than that,
let me know if you run into any issues.

Apologies for the delay - rough day :/

Best,

Vanessa
