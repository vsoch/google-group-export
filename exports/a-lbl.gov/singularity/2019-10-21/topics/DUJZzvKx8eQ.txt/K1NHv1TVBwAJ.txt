With the singularity 2.2.1 (installed by my simple user) on the system 
(centos 6.8) where I do not  have  root/sudo access I cannot run the image, 
if I type:

singularity shell ubuntu.img 

I get:

ERROR  : Singularity must be executed in privileged mode to use images
ABORT  : Retval = 255

Where can I get the devel package?

Thanks,

rd
