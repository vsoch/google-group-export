This might be overkill, but if you really want to make sure that your
container is the smallest it can be you can do the following.
- Create a container that is much bigger than you need and bootstrap it
- run `singularity exec big.img df` to check the size
- Create another container that is just barely bigger than the size
reported by df
- run the following: `sudo singularity export big.img | sudo singularity
import small.img`
