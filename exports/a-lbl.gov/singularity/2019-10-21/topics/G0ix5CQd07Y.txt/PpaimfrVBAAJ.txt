It might actually be useful to point out that this is a core philosophy
difference between Singularity and most other container platforms.  Most
container platforms are trying to be lightweight VMs.  They want to isolate
your container completely and totally from the underlying host system and
from one another.  This is useful for some applications.  But in many
cases, a user may want to do things like access files on the host system,
or leverage hardware like GPUs, high-speed interconnects, use the host
system network, etc. etc. With most container solutions, you start with the
highest level of isolation that is feasible, and you have to start poking
holes in your container when you want to do the things listed above.

Singularity takes the opposite approach.  The idea is that most users don't
really need or want complete isolation.  They are more concerned with
things like portability, reproducibility, and ease of use.  So Singularity
intentionally blurs the lines of isolation between your container and the
underlying host system.  That way you can leverage the resources on your
host system from within your container with ease.  If you *want* or *need*
higher levels of isolation, you can always add them using options like
--contain, --containall, --cleanenv, or any of the options to join
additional namespaces.  But the general idea is to start with a bare
minimum of isolation and then to build up more as necessary.

Hope that helps!

Dave
