a) Are there any special requirements to use this in a job scheduler?
b) Can this help minimize compute node storage footprints? (Ideally, yes)
c) How does non-OSS licensing work within your container/singularities? If
I have a paid/licensed code, can I ship with Singularity? Can my users use
Singularity with my non-OSS software? How would license frameworks like
FlexLM work in these cases?
d) Are there any security concerns?
e) Where do you want to see the project in a year? What is the proposed
feature set at that time?
f) What Linux distros are you trying to get onboard?
g) What are the current (overview) gaps that you see and how can members of
this community help solve them?
h) How does this operate with MPI applications?
i) Are there any performance tradeoffs?
j) What is the average air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
