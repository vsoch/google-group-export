Here are all the events from the Events API that I got from `gcli event 
repo dl-container-registry container-test`

As you can see, there are no deployment events, only `CreateEvent` and 
`PushEvent`. 

Without a way to debug the Auto-Deployment integration I'm not sure how to 
proceed... probably have to contact GitHub and ask them for the logs there 
to trace down the issue.
