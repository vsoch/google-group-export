Hello,

Unfortunately, I don't think there is a really good solution for this.
Installing binaries into /root or $HOME conflicts with the basic way that
Singularity is supposed to function and is a pretty poor practice anyway.
Maybe another community member has more insight.  Sorry I can't be of more
help.

Dave
