Hi everyone,

 as I posted earlier I investigated recently in sandboxing windows apps 
which I occasionally made work in some version of wine under linux.
It however always ended in me being very frustrated since they went broken 
quite easily and I mostly even couldn't figure out the reason why.

So I created a singularity container with the proper wine version / 
dependencies and config to make my GOG games install and run.
That was really fun :)

After Martin Cuma dug deeper I reworked the container building into a 
docker file which will basically allow anyone with the upcoming singularity 
2.3 to install and run containerized windows apps under linux entirely in 
user space.

Have a look at my write-up here: 
http://secret4u.spdns.org/index.php?/archives/3-Dolmades-Containerized-Windows-Apps-under-Linux.html

Feel free to give it a shot and send me feedback in case you have questions 
:)

Stefan
