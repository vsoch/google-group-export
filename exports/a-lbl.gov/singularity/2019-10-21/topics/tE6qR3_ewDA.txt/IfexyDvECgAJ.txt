What compiler are you using? Is it the same behavior with different compile=
rs?=20

Does anywhere in the code does it obtain the current working directory via =
a system call to getcwd() (or similar)?

Lastly can you capture and send me the output of:

$ singularity strace [containername]

Thanks!

<div>I went for older version of MOPAC, 6, for which sources are available, and looked into how it opens files. It does plain OPEN:</div>

<div>I wanted to circle back with you on this, and see if you made any progress. I have added a bunch of features that will help you in debugging:</div>

<br>
I have tried to use Singularity on an example of MOPAC2012 code. It does create a .sapp for me. I have included necessary files, license etc.<br>

So the containerized version starts, but attempt to run it as&nbsp; 'mopac.sapp test.mop' fails because it cannot create files.
<br>
<br>
$ ./mopac.sapp `pwd`/test.mop<br>
forrtl: No such file or directory<br>
forrtl: severe (29): file not found, unit 26, file /home/myuser/devel/sing-test/test.out<br>
<br>
MOPAC is a Fortran code and it would create test.out, test.arc and a few fort.XX files in the same directory. I suspect that it has to do with containerization of paths which I admit I do not fully understand. How do I specify path to the input file to make
 it work? Or, is there a trick in .sspec?<br>
