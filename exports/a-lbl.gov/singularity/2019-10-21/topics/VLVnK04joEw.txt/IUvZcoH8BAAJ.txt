Even worse when you are dealing with users who have controlled software.
Most container platforms don't offer the granularity of ACLs necessary to
limit container access to a subset of users on a particular host.

On second thought,... I don't even want to think about this... Purging from
memory so I can plead ignorance (which isn't hard for me). haha
