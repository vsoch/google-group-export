Hi Oriol,

generally bash is executing your .bashrc file only if it is executed in 
interactive mode. If you execute 'singularity shell <image>' it is the same 
as opening a new terminal window on your machine, i.e. bash is opened as an 
interactive shell. In fact, it is the same as executing 'singularity exec 
<image> /bin/bash', i.e. executing bash explicitly (without any additional 
arguments) inside the image. If you execute 'singularity exec <image> 
<whatever_command>', this is executed non-interactively, so generally your 
.bashrc is ignored. In principle you can execute your .bashrc explicitly 
also when running non-interactively, but usually this is not really desired 
(often you make setups in .bashrc that require an interactive shell). There 
are probably plenty of ways to approach this topic (setting env variables 
for interactive and non-interactive shells). I'd advise that you have a 
look at the bash documentation regarding this topic:

https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Bash-Startup-Files

If there env variables you want to set every time you open bash 
non-interactively (and not in login mode), you could probably make use of 
$BASH_ENV as described in the documentation.

Let me know if you have more questions.

Cheers,

Thomas
