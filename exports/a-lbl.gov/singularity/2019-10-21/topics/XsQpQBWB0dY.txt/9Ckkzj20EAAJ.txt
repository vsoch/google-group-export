Hey Simone,

I got this one! There is a problem with the older builder you are using,
and I need to deprecate the image. Give me a few minutes and I'll ping you
with an update (and I see you started another, just let it be for now I'll
take care of restarting it with an updated builder).

Best,

Vanessa
