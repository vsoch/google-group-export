Hi Karthik,

  By default, we'll open a port in the Host network space. So, if you
have an application listening on *:8888 running in a container, then
you should be able to access it from any of the Host IP addresses
directly. It's the same as if you ran the program on the Host
directly. You don't need to do anything special in this case, but
you'll only be able to have a single one running.

  With the network namespace you would be able to start up multiple,
and change the host port that gets mapped (i.e.  portmap=3D8888:8888/tcp
; portmap=3D8889:8888/tcp ; etc...).

  So, assuming that the startscript you have is starting up jupyter,
then just doing:

    sudo singularity instance start testnote/ tftest

  should work, and you would be able to connect to port 8888 on that host.
