Hi,

I've been running into a problem when trying to run singularity from a 
folder that is located in a cvmfs repository, i.e. this command:

singularity shell /cvmfs/cernvm-prod.cern.ch/cvm3

I get the following error message:

ERROR  : Could not create directory within container 
/usr/local/var/singularity/mnt/overlay/final/home/thomas: No such file or 
directory 
ABORT  : Retval = 255 

This seems to be related to the overlay option in the singularity conf, 
since it works fine if I just deactivate it. The interesting part is that 
this was working fine with singularity 2.2.1, from 2.3 on I get the error.

This thread is probably more directed to my fellow particle physicists / 
cvmfs users, since I don't seem to be able to reproduce this error without 
cvmfs being involved. Exporting an existing singularity image into a folder 
and running singularity from that doesn't result in the same error. Does 
anybody see this behaviour as well? I didn't see an issue regarding this 
problem yet on github.

Btw, the same happens when I try to use the containers provided in 
the singularity.opensciencegrid.org repository:

singularity shell 
/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-ubuntu-xenial:latest

Thanks,

Thomas
