Ahh. Well you could execute the SAPP directly as it is build with execute p=
ermissions. But when you execute it directly (./file.sapp) it does automati=
cally get installed/cached (unless you run it via Open MPI who caches it te=
mporarily and scalably for large runs).=20

VirtualBox seems very heavyweight, but it is an option for sure. I think Co=
reOS has builds like this, perhaps I should ask if they are interested in i=
ncluding Singularity.=20

Thanks again!

 As I understand it, before executing a sapp you must install singularity f=
