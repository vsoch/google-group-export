Hi,

I'm planning to use Singularity in a contest where participants would 
submit a repository with source code and a Singularity bootstrap file. We 
don't want them to submit their compiled container so we can analyze and 
check their patches/bugfixes.  This means we have to do the bootstrapping 
ourselves. Since this requires root access and executes code we have little 
control over, I was wondering how to best isolate the bootstrap call from 
the rest of the system.

We could limit what users are allowed write in their %setup section. Would 
that be sufficient or can the %post section break something outside of the 
container?

Do you have any recommendations?

Cheers
Florian
