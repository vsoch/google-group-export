Hey Evan,

I think /tmp is there for the same reason it's bound by default for run /
exec - Singularity was originally created and optimized for HPC, so we take
advantage of using the (local) /tmp to install packages. Also imagine if
/tmp *wasn't* bound - you'd have a lot of leftover temporary cruft in the
container, and it wouldn't be super useful since running the container
would bind the host /tmp over it. So I'd summarize that it's a good design
decision, but this might be more opinion than fact.

Best,

Vanessa
