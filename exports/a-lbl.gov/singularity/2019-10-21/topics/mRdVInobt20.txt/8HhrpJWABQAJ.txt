Hi Vanessa, 

many thanks for the follow up :-).

It works just as Docker does with regards to the build recipe, but is more flexible because it doesn't automatically add everything in sight (eg, why we have .dockerignore)Yes, I agress, singularity is much nicer in this regard (there are also many things I dislike about the Dockerfile format itself...).

Yes, I know - my complaint was really about the reproducibility of the actual build procedure.

> Is that even a good idea? These kinds of things might be more appropriate for a user to map to their own home (so the container doesn't store them, and in fact if you are in home you would map the calling user's home directory over it anyway) or to produce (again mapped to the user's host) at runtime. I don't think it's generally good practice to store credentials, certificates, etc. in the (static / not used) image.
For sure this is a very bad idea - I would never actually do that, this was just an example to get the idea. 

> yeah DON'T do that. That borders on malicious to have a user build a container and knowingly copy their secrets (whatever they might be) into it. 
I won't - but it would be nice if it was not possible from the start ;-). Better protect the users as good as possible ;-). 

> This is also an issue of education about security. This is just the same as saying I could add credentials to a Github repo and push it. But I think I get what you are saying - the user would be doing this unknowingly. All I can say is that they should look at the recipe file first, OR use a pre-built container that can't take their files and distribute them. 
That's exactly my point. Even from the recipe, it would not be obvious the container might pick up my credentials if I bootstrap it starting "singularity bootstrap" from inside my home,
unless you know that singularity, unlike Docker, uses the working directory as build context and not the location of the Singularity build recipe. 
Since most people will know Docker, that difference may come as a huge surprise. 

> I still don't follow. Singularity is exactly the same as Docker in this regard, the commands ADD/COPY correspond to our %files section, and the paths are relative to the build folder.
Basically, what I'd like to point out is that docker closes off all directories outside of the build directory - and the build directory is explicitly set to the location of the build recipe, and not the PWD. 
This prevents any accidental or malicious attempt to pick up stuff from the host which should not enter the container. 

> So you are saying you want to completely close off directories /outside /of the PWD / build directory? So I could add files relative, but not do something like ../../parent/directories ? That seems reasonable to do, we could add some kind of variable for a "build_dir" and spit out an error if the user tries to copy / go outside of it.
Exactly :-). 
I consider this would be more safe in the long run, and protect you from shooting yourself in the foot accidentally (at least in this way ;-) ). 
Additionally, I would prefer if the default build context would explicitly be the location of the Singularity recipe instead of PWD, but this goes hand in hand.

>  /shrug here, I guess I am naturally inclined to want to keep different projects / containers in their own folders, to match with my github repos.
I agree for the "classical" use case. In our case, we would like to build containers for different OSes - but meant to run on the same infrastructure,
and provide comparable environments. 
So it is natural they would share some resources, like stuff to go into /etc/profile.d/. 
But symlinks can solve that as well ;-).

>> It might be very useful if also users should be able to modify container recipes, but right now only we admins are taking care to prepare that ;-).
>  This would be the rationale for Github. If you have a recipe in a Github repo, a user can easily contribute via PR. Then you discuss, change, and it goes through tests. When the merge is done, then you have it deploy with a push to your registry. That way you have user contribution to (admin) served images, and it happens automatically with the PR merge/push. 
We will consider that in a later stage of the project, when our users are more used to containers.

The standard is to find (recursively) any file called "Singularity" and build if it's been updated. The extension of the file is the tag. So for your above files, you would have a repo connected to Singularity Hub with this organization:

Docker is the same - when you build it looks for the Dockerfile and local context. What would make sense is to have some standard organization of the build directory, and then have a common bootstrap file (adding files from the same folder, finding the definition) sort of automatically. Another idea is to have a wrapper around singularity that keeps a record of build bases (directories) associated with recipe or uri names, and then when you call to bootstrap /build with the uri, it changes directories appropriately, etc.

For containers, the work is done and the recipes are inside - this is what we care most about. For portability of the predecessor to the container (recipe, files) we use version control (eg Github) and we don't care about absolute paths. It's portable because someone else can download my repo, and build my container.
