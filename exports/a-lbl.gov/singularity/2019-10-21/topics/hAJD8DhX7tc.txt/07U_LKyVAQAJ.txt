Hi,

Indeed, if you have to put every path in configuration file ...
If singularity is executed while current working directory is home=20
directory, it produces error ?
Otherwise maybe you could try to put for in user directories a file=20
$HOME/.singularity-init with contents:

#!/bin/bash
>
> OLD=3D$PWD
> cd $HOME # force autofs mount
> cd $OLD
>

This file is sourced before executing shell/exec/run commands, it may help=
=20
you
