Also, a quick clarification for SingularityPRO subscribers.  The most 
recent update for 3.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.  So as long 
as you applied the update you are covered.  This vulnerability does not 
affect versions of Singularity previous to 3.1, so PRO subscribers using 
one of the 2.x LTS variants need not update.
