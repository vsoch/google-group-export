Hi,

About the size calculation, it is quite weird. I do not know if docker
compress its files inside its containers, but when you do an export and
import it into singularity, the size is bigger. I added 50% to the docker
size, just to be sure that it will be Ok for singularity (I think that
added only 30% to the docker size would be enough). If it is too small,
singularity complains that there is not enough space.

BTW, I think this thread should be splitted, because there are two
different topic in it.

Cheers,
R=C3=A9my
