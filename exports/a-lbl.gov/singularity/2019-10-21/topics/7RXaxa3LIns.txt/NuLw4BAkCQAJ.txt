Hello,

I'm trying to use Singularity as sort of replacement for VirtualBox/VMware, 
so I'd like to run full desktop environment in the container.  The idea is 
that given user has something like:
   exec singularity exec centos.simg /usr/bin/startkde
in its $HOME/.xinitrc file.  This way, when startx executed, the X server 
would be run on the host Linux system, to avoid eventual problems with 
graphics drivers.  On the other side, the desktop environment would be run 
in the container, so the user would practially do all of its work in the 
container Linux system.  It all pretty much works, in the sense that the DE 
get started as I'd like, however for each DE that I tried (KDE/Gnome/Xfce) 
there are later some problems, starting from some components of the DE not 
being able to start, and then menus and apanels not working, etc.  So I'm 
interested: has anyone else tried something alike, and are there any 
workarounds?

Thanks.
