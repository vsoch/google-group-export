Hey everyone!

This is a really great tutorial - and I'm worried that it (and the GitHub
repo) will be lost in thread, and scattered in the doldrums of GitHub repos
past. I want to suggest for this post (and future / past posts like it)
that we be strategic and put it somewhere that a user is likely to search
looking for it. We are working on a Stack Overflow for HPC called "Ask
Cyberinfrastructure" and frankly, it's the perfect spot.

https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/

So yes, like Stack, you are totally allowed to post and answer your own
questions. I'd like to suggest that we be proactive on this list to
identify tutorials / examples / etc. that have been helpful, and then
migrate the knowledge there. If anyone has (previous) posts they can
remember (for example, there has been a lot of trouble with MPI, and a lot
of suggestions for tensorflow!) let's post them on AskCI! Go ahead and do
it on your own, or if you want some help, this dinosaur can offer :)

Best,

Vanessa
