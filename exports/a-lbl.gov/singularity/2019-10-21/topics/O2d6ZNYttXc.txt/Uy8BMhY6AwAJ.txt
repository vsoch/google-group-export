Hi Jordi,

Their concerns make sense, but there are reasons why one might move
forward with Singularity regardless.

A few ways to think about the issue:

0) Any time you allow arbitrary code execution on a Linux host, there
are similar concerns (i.e., this is not a new concern but just a
level-of-risk).  I'd guess that there are 2-5 CVEs per year that
result in privilege escalation or BUG/Oops'ing of a kernel for folks
that have the ability to do arbitrary code execution: Singularity
images are indeed another route that this could occur (and you provide
an approximate line of reasoning to argue it may occur more often),
but it's disingenuous to say risk isn't present otherwise.
  - Singularity is often used at HPC or research computing centers
where the admins and users have a pre-existing trust relationship and
have non-technical routes to stop users from being malicious.  This is
a very different environment from, say, an arbitrary hosting provider.
  - To give a concrete example: if a local user was able to
maliciously trigger an Oops via Singularity, they would likely get
banned from the facility.
  - Malicious local users can also attack Infiniband drivers or
disrupt the cluster via clever abuse of the shared filesystem.  Do you
really believe your Infiniband driver is hardened against malicious
users?
  Hence, it's a measured risk; it's good to be aware of and understand
whether it is worth the benefits for your use case and community.
1) If you understand (0) but still would rather not take the risk,
alternates include:
  - Disabling setuid mode and use user namespace mode (this is a
separate set of trade-offs; see
http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-config#allow-setuid-boolean-defaultyes).
  - Only allowing images owned by a certain user (i.e., those owned by
root or "admin" or whatnot; see
http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-security#can-i-limit-usage-to-specific-users).
  Even if you only allow images owned by a certain user, Singularity
is quite useful: for example, one can take an existing image and
unpack it to a directory, then invoke singularity on the directory
itself.  It's one more step on the user side, but this acts more like
a traditional chroot and bypasses the concern you highlight above.

HTH,

Brian
