For some master container serving the manager, you could add the command to
start the services to the %startscript, and then start the container with
root (sudo). This would be running the container as an instance, e.g.,

sudo singularity instance start <container.sif> license-manager

I'm not fully understanding the "user A license" and "user B" license
scenario, but maybe pointing you in the direction of instances might get
you on a better start? Note that when you start/stop/list, having sudo (or
not) will only show those that were started with/without. The other thing
to point out above is that the %startscript is what is run when the
instance starts. The %runscript is still what's run when the container is
run.
