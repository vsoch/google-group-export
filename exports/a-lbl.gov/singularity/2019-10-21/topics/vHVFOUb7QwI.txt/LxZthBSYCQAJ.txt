Ohhhhh,!!!! I've been curious about Alpine Linux since I heard about it las=
t week at Stanford in a talk about Docker and HPC.=20

I will also install that into a VM and test it out, but I think you will be=
at me as I won't be able to do that until possibly next week. So please kee=
p me informed!!

They seem to use their own packaging tools so maybe we can get Singularity =
included in the distribution as soon as we get 1.0 released as stable.=20

I am curious, what do you do with all these distributions?=20

Thanks again!
