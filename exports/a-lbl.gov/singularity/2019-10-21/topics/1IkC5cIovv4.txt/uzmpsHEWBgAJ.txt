Hi,

When using the --contain / --containall options it appears that the nvidia 
mounts (--nv) also get excluded.  It might be for good reason because the 
libraries for the driver need to exist inside mounts to the root FS in 
order to make the nvidia drivers and libraries work.

Is there a best practice, or working solutions others have been using to 
deal with nvidia and also get protection for the file systems on the host ?

Thanks,
Karl
