Hey Vanessa, 

are all components of the docs supposed to be updated for 2.4 already? 

For example, in:
http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-export
I find that the recommended way to compress images would be:
singularity export container.img | gzip -9 > container.img.gz
Apart from the fact that "export" is not even a supported command anymore (and I think the Release Notes did not even mention the rename? That's ugly, that's a backwards incompatible change, please announce that!), if I run:
singularity image.export container.img | gzip -9 > container.img.gz
on a SquashFS-container the result will commonly be a *larger* container.img.gz file, which is then also actually a "tar.gz" file. 

Should I file that as an issue, or are there just some parts not yet updated for 2.4?

Cheers, 
	Oliver
