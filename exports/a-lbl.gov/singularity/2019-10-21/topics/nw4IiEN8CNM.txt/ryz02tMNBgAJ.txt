Hey Carla,

This is currently on the Roadmap for 3.0.  Turns out that this stuff is
really hairy to implement in C but is trivial in golang.  Because of this
and some other issues, much of the source code is being rewritten in go
<https://www.sylabs.io/2018/02/singularity-3-0/>.  That is the 3.0 release
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/development-3.0>.

I'm pretty naive in the ways of orchestration, but it sounds to me like you
are basically asking for a Kubernetes (K8s) pod.  K8s is supposed to be
able to orchestrate any containers as long as they are OCI compliant.
Right now, Singularity is not OCI compliant, but that is also on the
roadmap for 3.0.  3.0 should be in alpha by summer-ish.

Dave
