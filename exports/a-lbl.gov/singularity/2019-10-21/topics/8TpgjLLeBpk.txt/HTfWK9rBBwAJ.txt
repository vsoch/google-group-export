Heya Grigory,

Cat you send me the output of the following two commands:

$ grep singularity /etc/mtab
$ grep singularity /proc/mounts

Regarding the loop count, there is a kernel option to increase the number
of loop devices (I need to look it up again). Thanks for the pointer, we
will change the documentation or if someone wants to send us a PR, it would
be greatly appreciated (with SC, we got a lot of balls in the air already!)=
.

Thanks!

Greg

Like that, four times. And then goes the normal df output.<br>
What would cause that, is it a loopback device problem?<br>
<br>
<br>
Btw, in CentOS 6 and 7 =C5=92loop=C2=B9 appears to be no longer a module, s=
o the<br>
modprobe way documented on the webpage to increase number of loopback<br>
devices does not have effect. Moreover, in 3.10 vanilla kernel, the<br>

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=3Dy<br>
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT=3D<wbr>8<br>
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP=3Dm<br>
<br>
<br>
So is 8 the minimal count, and they would be created automatically, or one<=
br>
still needs to increase the number?<br>
