Hi, 

I've been using Singularity 2 (2.4.2 and 2.6) and recently switched 
Singularity 3.0. I noticed that building with --writable is no longer 
available in 3.0. I have a few questions about backward and forward 
compatibility of containers built with older versions and used with newer 
versions and vice versa. What should I expect? Will these work without 
problems? This is relevant to me because the server machines I use have 
different versions of Singularity. 

Also, while developing, I would often build containers with --writable 
option and transfer them to the server. Using --sandbox in 3.0 does not 
seem to work as well as SCP complained about transferring some of the files 
in the sandbox directory. What is the recommended workflow in 3.0? Should I 
always convert the writable sandbox container to a immutable container 
before transferring to the server? Or compress the sandbox folder and 
decompress it on the server? 

Thank you,
Renato
