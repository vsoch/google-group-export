Thanks Greg, 

I just now got a chance to try things but I am getting a different error. 
When I try to submit a build, I get a "cumulative build time exceeded" 
error. I assume since this is a "free" service there is a built in cap. I 
only was able to build a few containers. Is it possible that by leaving the 
build running below it caused my time to be exceeded? I left them running 
for hours although nothing ever built? What is the amount of time we are 
allotted?

Our company HPC team is working on creating a local build service, but 
until that is done, I have no way to create containers.

Thanks.
