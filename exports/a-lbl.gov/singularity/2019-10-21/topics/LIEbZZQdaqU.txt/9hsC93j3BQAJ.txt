Hi Martin,

Are you using the 'master' branch of Singularity or the 'development'
branch currently for testing? Sorry for the confusion on branches, we are
migrating ourselves to the proper GitFlow development model, and we should
be fully transitioned by the 2.3 release (but at the moment, the 'master'
branch is a dead end).

Thanks,

Greg
