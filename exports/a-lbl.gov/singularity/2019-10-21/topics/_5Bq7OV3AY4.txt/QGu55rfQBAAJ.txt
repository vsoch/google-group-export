I'm trying to switch from manually mounted nvidia libraries to the new 
"--nv" singularity option, but I get this warning (using an existing 
squashfs container):

    WARNING: Library bind directory not present in container, update 
container

even though I have "enable overlay = yes" in my singularity.conf.

The weird thing is that in spite of the warning, the nvidia libraries *do* 
get mounted in "/.singularity.d/libs", and if I add that directory to 
LIBRARY_PATH then (e.g.) nvidia-smi does work. But the LIBRARY_PATH is not 
updated automatically (and it should, I guess?).

Any advice would be very welcome.
