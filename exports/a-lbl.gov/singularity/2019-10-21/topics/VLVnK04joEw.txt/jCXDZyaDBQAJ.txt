Okay, after giving it more thought I found another solution for our needs:

Have a look at this little patch:

             singularity_message(ERROR, "Could not open image (read only)=

-            ABORT(255);

privileges...\n");

+            }
+            singularity_priv_drop();
         }
     }

----

Here's the output when I run the patched exec:

[ul_l_nsn25@adm02 ~]$ ls -lah vre2 && singularity exec -p vre2 ps aux  =20
-rwx------ 1 root root 1.1G Oct 27 14:32 vre2
ERROR  : Could not open image (read only) vre2: Permission denied
ERROR  : Trying with escalated privileges...
ERROR  : Now we succeeded :)

ul_l_ns+     1  0.0  0.0   7132   636 pts/0    R+   08:12   0:00 ps aux

If I apply this exec.exec falls back to escalated privileges to open the=20
singularity container. That way root can be the owner and have exclusive=20
read/write access to it.
As I understand any other command shouldn't have access to that container=
=20
then. Is there anything to be considered security-wise?
Would be lovely to have such functionality merged into master.

thanks and greetings Stefan
