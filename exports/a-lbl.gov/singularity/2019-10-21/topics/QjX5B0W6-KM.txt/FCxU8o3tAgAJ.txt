Hello everyone,

I need to run a container on a cluster from a shared location. In the 
%runscript of the container,  I need to write the results to a file and 
read it back again to parse it . 

I can't use --bind since I don't know the shared location prior to building 
the container (so the shared location won't exist in the container) and 
it's different from a cluster to another.  

I'm having a problem writing these files in a shared location .  Any ideas 
please?

Thank you,
