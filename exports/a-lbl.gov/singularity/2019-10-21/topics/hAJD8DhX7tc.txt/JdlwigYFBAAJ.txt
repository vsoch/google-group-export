We have several interactive compute servers for our users. Over the last 
few months, we have deployed singularity, and have several users who are 
making heavy use of it!

Correlated with that use have been numerous contacts due to the 'Too many 
levels of symbolic links' error.

I am familiar with the issues posted and the workaround in the development 
branch right now, and I think that will likely solve the issue for most 
users, but not us unfortunately. Also, we see this error on automounted 
directories for users who do not use singularity at all. I suspect autofs 
is in a bad state as a result of the namespace collision/misunderstanding.

My understanding of the workaround in singularity is that you simply open 
directories listed in the config file before you leave the namespace. This 
makes everything work as autofs expects things to work (our autofs - Ubuntu 
14.04 3.13.0-68 I believe to be namespace agnostic). The reason it does not 
work for us is that we use automount for our users' home directories. We 
would have a config file several thousand lines long and this would defeat 
most of the benefit of autofs in the first place. We are looking at 
narrowing the user list down to the actual users, and gating access with 
the config file change necessary for new users, but we would rather not do 
that.

Finally, I am still in the dark about the errors outside singularity and 
what state the automounter is in when producing these errors. I have 
observed the following simultaneously:

one user's home directory produces the error on every attempted access, and 
I am unable to unmount it manually (umount: dir: not mounted)
unmounted directories can be mounted by running `ls` but there is about a 
30 second timeout before it happens - once mounted they return directory 
contents quickly
another user's home directory was producing the error, but after a time I 
was able to mount it and read it again, so it had unmounted successfully at 
some point

My investigations are a bit stymied right now as autofs is very opaque. The 
`automount` service/daemon simply manages the mount points and spends 
almost all of its life in sigtimedwait. All the cool stuff happens in the 
kernel.

Also to note is that Ubuntu 14.04 is not blessed with systemd and we are 
not running docker or any other container systems, so I do not know of any 
other software other than singularity using namespaces on the systems.

I hope other singluarity users and contributors who have had any 
experiences with this issue can chime in on what they have seen, and maybe 
we can figure out if we are just running systems too old for this, or if 
there is a fix that will make everyone happy.

Thanks,

-Ben
