Greetings Singularity-ers!

It is my great pleasure to announce the release of version 2.6.0! This 
release has a few bug fixes and lot of cool new feature.  Check the release 
notes for more info.

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.6.0

Please note that 2.6.0 is expected to be the final feature release in the 
2.x series. While bug fixes may be added via point releases (for example 
2.6.1) no new features releases (for example 2.7.0) are planned.

Pull requests adding features to the 2.x series will no longer be reviewed. 
Any new features should be targeted to the master branch (which used to be 
called development-3.0).

Please ALSO note that this release coincides with a major branch 
reorganization.  The biggest change is that we are no longer using 
development branches.  master is the new development.  For more information 
about the reorganization of Singularity branches in the GitHub repo, please 
see this Sylabs lab notes.

to this message or ask on Slack.  

Dave
