Singularity Global Client is a *command line* tool that will give a single
user a small manager for images.
Tunel is an interface to the global client, meaning you can do most of the
same commands in a GUI, and generate recipes, build, etc. Tunel is not the
same as Singularity Python, but it uses it on the backend to provide the
recipe converter.
Singularity python converts back and forth between Dockerfile and
Singularity recipe. I'm not sure what you mean by generate from scratch?
There is always a human element needed to write (some) initial recipe,
unless you want to give a go at using machine learning to do it.
The Experiment Factory is currently Docker only to deploy behavioral
experiments. You don't use it to generate recipes or containers.

I think others will be able to better help if you can say what you mean by
"generate recipes" or containers. This is usually done by a human. If you
mean *build* then you should go back and look at my original suggestion.
You don't need new or fancy tools, the free-to-use common tools like travis
CI <https://travis-ci.org/> building from Github work quite well, and
really you just need to choose somewhere to deploy to when the build is
succesful / tests pass. I suggested a singularity registry server
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry> because it plugs into
Singularity *and* can be used by it's client
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli>, but there are many options
<https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment>!
