The legal swirl around licenses is always problematic, especially for us en=
gineers as we are not trained nor qualified to really interpret them. The s=
olution is thankfully quite simple.

You _must_ have the permission of your employer to contribute to an open so=
urce project. This protects not only the project, but you as an individual.=
 Most employers have clauses you sign when taking employment that stipulate=
 that what you do belongs to them (lots of variation in language), and so i=
t is vital that you obtain their permission. This is why projects have cont=
ributor agreements, which is something Greg may want to consider so he can =
ensure people have performed this critical step. I suspect LBNL added the c=
lause of concern specifically to protect themselves from people who failed =
to obtain such permission.

So take the license to your employer=E2=80=99s HR/legal office, tell them y=
ou=E2=80=99d like to contribute to this project, and get their approval. Th=
is resolves the headache of trying to figure it all out for yourself, and p=
rotects all sides from future issues.
