Paul,

You can assign a static IP by using the `static` plug-in. Several examples 
of this is under the `singularity` `etc` directory.

etc/singularity/network/20_ipvlan.conflist
etc/singularity/network/30_macvlan.conflist

The CNI plug-ins documentation can all be found here: 
https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins

Let me know if you have further questions. Thanks!

Thanks,

Justin
