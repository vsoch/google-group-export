Hello everyone.

I am using one scientific code (EDMFT developed by K.Haule) for studying 
the electronic structure of the materials. This code is based on python, 
which I have compiled in the singularity container without any error.

When the code is run from the present working directory (PWD) 
1. It generates some new files and *new_directory*.
2. It will read and write the data from the PWD as well as from the 
*new_directory* (PWD/*new_directory*).

The code is running perfectly fine in the container with the proper result.

But the problem is coming, when I am running the same program using the 
singularity container image file with the *exec *command. The code, which 
is execute by singularity is not able to communicate between the data of 
the PWD and the *new_directory, *which is leading to unexpected result. 

I am surprised that why it is occurring.

Please suggest to solve this problem.

Thank you in advance,
Antik
