Hey Robin,

I don't know much about spack, but here is something to try that (I think?)
worked for your step. I think it's likely that calling the script without a
shell is using your system default (which is dash?) so my first attempt I
tried specifying /bin/bash directly. A few things to try! First, what if
you try calling the script with the interpreter that you would want to use?
For example, here is my bootstrap file:

BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest
%post

apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install git python3 python3-dev
git clone https://github.com/llnl/spack
SPACK_ROOT=/spack
export SPACK_ROOT
/bin/bash $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh

Note that I also installed pythons, because I think spack needs some python
in the environment to work? Then on the command line

singularity create spack.img
> sudo singularity bootstrap spack.img Singularity


That seemed to work for me, maybe give it a try? Here is my complete
debugging (errors and all!) https://asciinema.org/a/118176?speed=3 if you
want to see a practice in stupidity and discovery, lol. The next step, I
think, would be to add the spack path to `%environment` to make sure the
executables are found, chmod u+x to make them executable if necessary, and
then add a call to the main one to the `%runscript`.

Best,

Vanessa


%setup
SHELL=/bin/bash
export SHELL
