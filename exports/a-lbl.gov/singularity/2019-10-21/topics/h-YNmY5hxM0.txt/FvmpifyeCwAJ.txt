Hi Vanessa,

sorry for hijacking the thread, but does singularity shell -w really need 
sudo (with v2.3)? I found (to my own surprise) that you can actually run 
this command without sudo (tested in v2.2.1 though). Of course, everything 
inside the image under / is owned by root, but in principle you could add a 
"user" folder which has permissions set to rwx for everybody. When I made a 
personal copy of such an image I was able to make persistent changes in 
said folder, even without any root permissions. I have to admit I didn't 
try v2.3 yet, but will singularity complain now if you do singularity shell 
-w, even though the image is owned by yourself?

Thanks,

Thomas
