Hi Manuel,

afaik there is no reason that you would need to build different Singularity
packages for the servers and workstations.

It's great that you are trying to support different versions of
Singularity.  But please keep in mind that it is not really the way the
Singularity is designed. Because Singularity is not a normal scientific
type of application, (i.e. it is installed with a set uid bit) it's not
really suggested that you support multiple versions on your system.  As it
stands now, versions < 2.3.1 must *not* be installed because of security
flaws and if overlayfs is enabled/authorized you must also delete anything
< 2.4.1.  All of our security-related patches are documented here
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases>.

This is actually the kind of thing that Sylabs was founded to address.  If
you want to support multiple versions and be up-to-date on any security
fixes, you should consider Singularity Pro
<http://www.sylabs.io/singularity/#singularitypro>.

Dave
