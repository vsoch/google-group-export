So a few things in no particular order -- thanks for this software, BTW -- 
I finally have had a use case for it:

1) I downloaded 2.0.9 from EPEL and my Lustre file system (mounted at 
/HPCTMP_NOBKUP) gave an error if you try to use the image from one of the 
directories, and you can't work with any files from the whole tree. I 
discovered that there are bind path settings to use, but this 2.0.9 RPM 
doesn't appear to have a singularity.conf file, and doesn't appear to pay 
any attention to one if you add one to /etc/singularity (which does exist).

2) I downloaded 2.1.2 as a .tar.gz and went through the instructions to 
create an RPM. It creates a non-ideally-named RPM: 
singularity-2.1-0.1.el6.x86_64.rpm. Shouldn't it be 2.1.2-0.1 or something 
like that?

3) Still having trouble using files in my Lustre directories with 2.1.2. I 
can now see the current directory well enough it seems. /HPCTMP_NOBKUP is 
still empty. So I tried adding it to the now-existing singularity.conf 
file. Then I started getting "WARNING: Non existant 'bind point' in 
container: '/HPCTMP_NOBKUP'" without it working any better.

4) Is there any way to sign up for this list with a regular e-mail address? 
My work has a Google domain but I'm not allowed to use it as my primary 
e-mail (a restriction placed on some staff -- long stupid story). I can't 
seem to figure out a way to sign up as my real work address, without I 
guess creating another non-Gmail Google account using my work e-mail 
address. Is there something smarter?

Thanks again. If you wouldn't mind copying novo...@rutgers.edu, I'd 
appreciate it.
