Hi Guillaume,

I think you can use -B (for bind) and -H (for home) to do what you need.
You might also have a look at the options in singularity.conf file (and
perhaps the overlayfs option).

Anyway, you can always change your permissions to 777 recursively on that
directory and bind it to the same destination in the container.

Best regards,
R=C3=A9my

so they are available to the user, then we are checking to see if the user =
has a shell of choice specified, and then falling back to /bin/sh, and spec=
ifying the little prompt you see (/Singularity ubuntu in the example above)=
 with $PS1, and then executing it (and then you shell in!) and of course if=
 this fails, you get an error message.</div><div><br></div><blockquote clas=
