Greetings Singularity community!

The 3.2.0 release contains fixes for a high severity security issue 
affecting Singularity >=3.1.0 on Linux kernels that support namespace 
requirements (pid namespace) for creating and joining instances 
(CVE-2019-11328). A malicious user with local/network access to the host 
system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure 
permissions allowing a user to edit files within 
/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>. The manipulation of 
those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when 
instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the 
host.

Singularity 3.2.0 should be installed immediately, and all previous 
versions of Singularity should be removed. The vulnerability addressed in 
this release affects systems on which unprivileged users are permitted to 
initiate and join instances via the suid workflow. If you are unable to 
upgrade immediately, you should disable the suid workflow on your system. 
You can do so by setting the following in the singularity.conf file:

allow setuid = no 

Special thanks to Matthias Gerstner from the SUSE security team for finding 
and securely reporting this vulnerability.  Please note that we have made a 
request to Mitre to publish the CVE, but we have no control over how 
quickly they do that.  The CVE may not be public for a day or so.

In addition to a security patch, 3.2.0 has a lot of great features. 
Highlights include a new plugin system, the added ability to create 
multi-stage builds, and better integration with the Singularity Container 
Services KeyStore. More details appear in the release notes at the link 
below:

And if you think that you've discovered a security vulnerability please 
report it to:

Thanks!  

Your pals at Sylabs
