I uploaded a crapton of packages:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-hub/tree/master/shub/apps/shub/data/packages

along with a standard script
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-hub/commit/f4886157a7c9a671ee2f7e56ea73122984149f08>
that when someone installs / starts the hub, it automatically adds these
base images. The reason for having some base set is to calculate similarity
and automatically categorize any newly uploaded image.

My next task was to make bootstrap description files for the base images
(so we could provide those and advise users to build off of), but we ran
into the issue of discussing a possible redo to the spec. I got your
response but I don't have much comment or opinion on these things - I'm
pretty much ok with anything, and was just thinking it might make sense for
user-friendliness to make them look more "Dockery"  The second reason for
doing this is because it would be very easy to convert a Dockerfile (seen
any of those laying around anywhere?) into a singularity spec file!

I have my final talk Tues and have been busy with um, highly important
things <https://github.com/vsoch/pokemon-ascii>, but I'll be back to
working on shub this week!
