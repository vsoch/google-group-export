I think you would need to remove the entire .snakemake directory, this is a
different thing than the Snakefile. For my pipeline I only needed it to run
once (not repeated subjects) so I'd just delete all the data that was
produced for the first run and it would run again. So I would be sure to
remove the .snakemake folder (if it exists) and then if the issue still
arises perhaps consider making a fresh temporary directory for each
(different) subject.

I need to make dinner but I can take a look tomorrow if you are having
trouble still!
