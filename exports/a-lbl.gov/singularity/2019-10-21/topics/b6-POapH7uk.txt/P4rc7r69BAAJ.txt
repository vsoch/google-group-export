Hi Adam,

You bring up a somewhat tricky situation and it has caused problems in the
past because things would get built and installed to directories that were
only bind mounted into the container during bootstrap, and thus making the
containers non-portable. While, yes, of course it could be done properly,
it has proven that it doesn't.

One thing you could do (I haven't tested this, but the theory is
reasonable), is use the %setup section. This gets executed outside of the
container, and before the %post, so you could do something like:

%setup
mkdir "$SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/binddir"
mount --no-mtab --bind "/path/to/local/dir" "$SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/binddir"

%post
cd /binddir
...


Because the bootstrap occurs within a mount namespace (CLONE_NEWNS), you
never have to umount it as it will vanish automatically when the bootstrap
process is done.

Hopefully that helps!
