I am hoping my compute nodes can grab the appropriate images on demand from
a prioritized list of mirrors/hubs/neighbors one day.  So I can assume when
a job launches, if the container isn't there it can try go get it from a
fast/efficient source.  This way if there is a unique name + trusted md5
sum on a container in the mirror it will just make it pull it local
as/when/if needed.
