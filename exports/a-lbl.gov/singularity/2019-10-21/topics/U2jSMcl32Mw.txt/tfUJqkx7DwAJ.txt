I want a container where I can build *something* from sources.  Yet, I 
don't want all those build tools in my final deployed container.  I also 
don't want to install all the build dependencies in the actual machine; I 
want that build environment in its own container.

Could someone suggest a process to follow?  For specific examples, they 
might be gvim from git (https://www.vim.org/git.php) or tensorflow.  I know 
there are pre-build installs that I could use for those specifically, so 
they are just examples that might be used for explanation.

Generally, the process would be: create container with all build tools and 
source, build, "save" build.  Create a new container.  "install" the saved 
build.  What I don't understand are the specifics for what I just 
described.  Should I somehow create a .rpm file that I would install in the 
deployment container?

Thank you for any guidance and I appreciate as many specifics as you can 
give.
