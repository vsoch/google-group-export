Jie,

What we should do is to run strace on the date command inside the
singularity container not on the singularity command itself. Mount this
singularity container singularity-centos7.img in read/write mode on your
endpoint, install strace package into it. After then when you invoke
mpirun_rsh run it like this:

mpirun_rsh -np 1  host1  singularity exec singularity-centos7.img strace
date

Thanks,
Krishna.
