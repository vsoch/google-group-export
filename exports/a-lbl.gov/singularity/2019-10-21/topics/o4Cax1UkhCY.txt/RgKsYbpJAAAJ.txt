Hey Jared,

Cool, I really like the idea of macros too, I'm going to think more about
this!

Containers as working environments or services are a strong and compelling
use case, and for one reason or another I don't see it commonly
articulated. Since you are working on this, your feedback and ideas about
the new upcoming (version 2.4) image format would be greatly valuable, when
the time comes for testing. I'm sure we will post a note on the list!

Yes that's exactly the idea!

mounts, commands, arguments etc. Those things in itself are another layer
that to the user looks like it could be part of the container, but it's
not. It's almost like we need an external runscript to be a controller that
is also carried with the container.
