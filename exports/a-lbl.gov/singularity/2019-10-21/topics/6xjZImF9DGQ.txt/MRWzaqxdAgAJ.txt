Hi,

I would like to be able to use Singularity to run a parallel(MPI) process 
from a Docker image that I created. The Docker image contains everything 
that I need to execute the code. In the Docker image I have defined a user 
called "MyUser" that has environment variables set so that "MyUser" can run 
the code e.g. PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH point to locations in /opt that 
house the binaries and libraries for running my code. I created a bash 
shell script that defined environment variables as well as a few aliases. 
It's called "image_env_setup.sh".  If I run the Singularity image 
using "singularity exec -H $HOME <ImageName> /bin/bash --rcfile 
/opt/Loci-Stream/image_env_setup.sh" then it seems to start up the 
container with everything set. If I remove the --rcfile command line flag, 
then the container boots up without any of the definitions. I was thinking 
about defining them in the Dockerfile as ENV variables, but those would be 
for "MyUser", and not for the user of whoever starts the Singularity 
container.

My code run command is: /opt/Loci-Stream/bin/stream --scheduleoutput 
--nochomp -q solution loxSpray > /dev/null > run.out 2>&1 &

Is there something special that I need to do in order to have that long 
execution command? The ideal command that I imagine would be present in a 
PBS scheduler file for running the code would be:

mpirun -np 10 singularity exec 
../Loci-Stream/docker/locistream_stream_v206_opensuse423_stream_v206-2017-10-18-74978838ae60.img 
/opt/Loci-Stream/bin/stream --scheduleoutput --nochomp -q solution loxSpray 
> /dev/null >run.out 2>&1 & --rcfile /opt/image_env_setup.sh

^^Singularity doesn't like this though


I'm also trying to get it to run via the 'singularity run' command:
mpirun -np 10 singularity run -H /home/user/source/temp/test_case 
../Loci-Stream/docker/locistream_stream_v206_opensuse423_stream_v206-2017-10-23-6face3b78607.img  
"/opt/Loci-Stream/bin/stream --scheduleoutput --nochomp -q solution 
loxSpray > /dev/null >run.out 2>&1 &" 

But this is not currently working either.

High level question:
1.) What is the proper way to send in a long and complex execution command 
for my binary?
