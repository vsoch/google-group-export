Hi Greg,

Yes, my java installation is on a shared location that is bounded to the 
container. As Vanessa said, I see this behavior is done on purpose and the 
way to deal with it would be to make sure the PATH only have what I need to 
run in the container or call the executable directly. 
Thanks for your help, I need to think more about it to find the best way to 
manage that.
Regards,

oriol

I have been testing singularity to use it in our cluster. I was surprised t=
o see that the software that is installed in the computer where singularity=
 runs, it is also available from inside the container. For instance, I have=
 an R script that calls a java jar and I&#39;m calling it from singularity.=
 I do not have java installed in my container but it is still working becau=
se it uses the java that is installed in my computer.<br>
<br>
Is this behavior normal in containers? How to make sure that is using, for =
instance, the java that is installed in the container and not the one in my=
 computer? Is it just a matter of playing with the PATH? By the way, the ja=
va issue is just an example.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your comments,<br>
