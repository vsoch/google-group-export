Other security-sensitive projects tend to have LTS branches that 
continue to be supported with only security udates for a specified 
amount of time.

We would need to know that we'll have patches to backport to the version 
in Stable.

All I know about that is what's written here:
   https://www.debian.org/security/faq#oldversion

I /think/ firefox is like that (as opposed to firefox-esr, which is what 
ends up in Stable). But some people do use Unstable and maybe a 
combination of Testing and Unstable, but you'd have to be vigilant and 
know what you're doing.

We have stable-backports, but packages are only allowed there if they're 
destined for the next Stable--to ensure an upgrade path between releases.

I'm not sure how readily an exception is granted for lack of a patch in 
Debian, but it can cause disruption even if it is granted. Browsers are 
given exceptions-- firefox-esr (which even still has major release 
updates in Stable) and chromium, which can break packaged browser 
extensions, etc.

I could ask specifically about getting potential exceptions for 
Singularity, but it was never mentioned as a possibility when the 
security team reached out.

Afif
