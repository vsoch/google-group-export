mpirun and its attendant daemons are running outside the container, and you=
 are correct that this can create an issue. We=E2=80=99ve been resolving it=
 by ensuring that PMIx (which is the only point of contact between the app =
and the daemons) has the ability to run cross-version. Will be enabled in u=
pcoming PMIx release.

Containerizing mpirun won=E2=80=99t help as the issue is compatibility betw=
een the mpirun infrastructure and the app, and either side might be statica=
lly linked or have a different OMPI version in its container/path.
