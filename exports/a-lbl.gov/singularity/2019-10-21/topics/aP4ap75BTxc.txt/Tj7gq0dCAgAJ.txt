Hello Singularity enthusiasts!

It is my pleasure to announce the release of Singularity 2.4.3 

This is a bug fix point release to the 2.4 feature branch, and includes a 
number of bug fixes as well as a security related fix that affects 
Singularity running on older kernels. If this security issue affects you 
(see below) you should consider this a high priority update:

### Security related fixes
 - Close file descriptors pointing to a directory #1305

Details:
It may be possible for a malicious user to keep a directory open pointing 
to anything on the host filesystem within a container in such a manner that 
would bypass the security precautions already in place. Hosts that do not 
support the `prctl()` function `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` are at risk. Most 
current distributions of Linux support this feature (e.g. RHEL6 with 
kernels newer then 2.6.32-504.16.2), and it is recommended to update to the 
latest upstream distribution release if you can. 

### Bug Fixes
 - Fix permission denied when binding directory located on NFS with 
root_squash enabled
 - Add capability to support all tar compression formats #1155
 - Handle docker layer aufs whiteout files correctly (requires libarchive).
 - Updated output of image.print command #1190
 - Fixed parsing of backslashes in apprun script #1189
 - Fixed parsing of arch keyword from definition file #1217
 - Fixed incompatibility between --pwd and --contain options #1259
 - Updated license information #1267
 - Fix non-root build from docker containers with non-writable file/dir 
permissions
 - Fix race condition between container exit and cleanupd while removing 
runtime directory

Please do remember to have fun!
