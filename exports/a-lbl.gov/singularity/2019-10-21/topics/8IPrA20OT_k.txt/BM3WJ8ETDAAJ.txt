Hi Greg,

Two things come to mind:
- Would it be possible to use squashfs as the base image?  Ideally, that wo=
uld allow one to create a singularity image without root access.
- Would it be possible to volume mount a squashfs image into the container?
  - We have some software that eats tons of inodes and is easier to distrib=
ute in the shared file system as a single squashfs image.

Not sure it has to be 2.2, but trying to think ahead.

Brian
