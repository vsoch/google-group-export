Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity with SLURM

Thanks much for nitpick - it's helpful tip.

I ran few test with R /w and w/o S and it seems like Slurm (or 'ps'
command) doesn't know anything about Singularity - it only detects actual
process.
Singularity doesn't spawn a separate process.

For example, when I run R and check 'ps ax' output:

* R 3.4.1 /w S:
9870  8.8  0.0 231732 36092 pts/8    S+   15:44   0:00
/opt/R/3.4.1/lib64/R/bin/exec/R

* R 3.2.0 native:
7240  0.6  0.0 179356 30520 pts/8    S+   15:37   0:00
/cluster/shared/apps/R/3.2.0/lib64/R/bin/exec/R

The 'ps' command (and as result the Slurm ) only 'sees' the R process.

R 3.4.1 /w S uses slightly more memory compared to R 3.2.0 native.
It's hard to tell if it's related to Singularity or new R version uses more
memory.

So far it looks OK and there should be no reason for Slurm to kill S jobs.
It's possible that the issue is related to Slurm itself - I think we few
version behind current Slurm version.

Thank you.
