Excellent, the work in 2.x really helps with a lot of this confusion.

For %files, relative paths should be explicit via the ./ location (e.g.
./file). But this will cause a problem as it will be installed into your
home directory within the container and you probably don't want that for
reasons of portability with other potential users.

%packages is really just an alternative way to list out files. It uses the
RPM database (if on RPM) to locate all of the files a given RPM package
provides, and then uses that for the %files list.

Yes, but as I mentioned, this could cause a problem with regards to paths
within the container. Those paths might not be available to other users
outside the container.

Yep, but best to install them into the OS directory or a shared location
and then reference them from there within your spec. (does that make sense?)

Nope, the conda installs should have already been done and complete by the
time you build, that way it can be included in the resulting SAPP. While
you could in theory design a container which will download content when you
run the container, I would avoid this if possible.

The problem is not you, it is lack of documentation. And in lieu of lack of
documentation, please ask away!

Thanks!
