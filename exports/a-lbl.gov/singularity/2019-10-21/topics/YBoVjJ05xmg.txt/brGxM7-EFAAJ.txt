But of course you'd still lose any customizations you might have done with
--writable. But using "writable" has always been "at your own risk." But it
shouldn't be the case, imho, that building from another image or multiple
builds with different recipes (where every action is written down in some
recipe) results into a non-reproducible build, which is what we currently
have. But it's good that it's been noticed, so it can be properly fixed.
