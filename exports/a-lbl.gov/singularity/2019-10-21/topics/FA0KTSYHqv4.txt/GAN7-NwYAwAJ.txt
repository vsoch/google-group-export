That is how I'd recommend doing it as well. Perhaps do a:

if sudo true; then
...
if

As far as prefixing the docker commands with sudo, it seems reasonable and
it should always work.

Temporary files are generally bad especially when they are large, but you
could in theory write the tar to disk, measure the size, and then create
the singularity container and import.

Hrmm, scratch that.... Horrible idea. Lol

I like this idea for the /singularity run script.

I am not totally familiar with the differences between entry point and cmd.
Does entry point describe the shell to use within the container?
