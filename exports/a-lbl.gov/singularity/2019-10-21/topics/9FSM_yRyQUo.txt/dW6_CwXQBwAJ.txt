You know, the build process is all shell (with the exception of the test
which can be skipped) so I would envision at least the build components
could be easily copied into a Docker container. Now as far as the C bits,
yes, we can easily build it statically! Once we get released this is
something I would hope a volunteer would maintain. <hint hint poke poke>

Thanks!
