Why is it unfortunate that it got into Fedora?

Singularity no longer requires flock() for the image. It does require it
within the session directory which should always be configured to be a
local file system.

That is good to know. Are you running a desktop installation? I've seen
some GUI environments also try to display the Singularity image as a
mounted filesystem in the file viewer/desktop and then not want to release
it. Perhaps that is related to the dbus issue you've seen.
