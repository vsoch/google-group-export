Jason, thanks for your answer.  Definitely, that's not a path we would like 
to follow.  Yes, our desired option is to have this application removing 
the need for root access via `sudo`.  We are actively working on it - what 
is a no-no is to have users with root privileges from the host OS.  
Anyways, your comment is really appreciated!
-Hugo
