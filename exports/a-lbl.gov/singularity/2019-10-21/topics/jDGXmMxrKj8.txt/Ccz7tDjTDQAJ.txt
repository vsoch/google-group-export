Greg,

  Would adding something like:

    uninstall-local:
       rm -f $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)/lib/singularity/libsingularity.so.1.0.0
       rm -f $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)/lib/singularity/libsingularity.so.1
       rm -f $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)/lib/singularity/libsingularity.so
       rm -f $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)/lib/singularity/libsingularity.la
       rm -f $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)/lib/singularity/libsingularity.a

  etc... etc... work in the src/lib/Makefile.am (and wherever else
it's needed). It's been many a moon since I've looked at using libtool
for anything, so the Makefile setup isn't cut and dry from a quick
perusal of it and there may be a much saner say to do it.

-J
