I' am new to singularity and been reading the docs, but still am unsure 
about whether I can use it the way I'd like. I have a tool I cannot install 
on my cluster (which I don't have root access to), but I can easily install 
on an ubuntu image on google compute engine (GCE). But the input data 
needed by the tool is >100GB in size (so it would be costly to load all the 
data onto the GCE image and run the analysis). So ideally I'd like to do 
the following:

1. Create the singularity image on an ubuntu GCE machine.
2. Copy the image to my cluster.
3. Run the image and point it to the data on the cluster filesystem for it 
to run on. Then get it's output and save to the cluster filesystem.

Sorry I think this is a basic question, but if anyone could help. Thanks!
