Hi Vanessa,

thanks for the detailed reply - and the reminder to use branches - which I 
as a sole developer of a few codes often forget about ;-)

You say:
"When you give access to Singularity Hub, you are *only* granting 
permission to Singularity Hub to see those repos."

It is still not clear to me how Singularity Hub gets permissions to access 
the organization's repos. I got access to all my repos when I signed in SH 
with my GitHub account, but, the organization repos, even though they are 
public, were not available until I turned off the third-party apps access 
restrictions for the organization.

From what I can tell when reading around - it's the third party app that 
requests access and that then shows up in the organization's third party 
to-approve app list, as eluded 
here: https://help.github.com/articles/approving-third-party-applications-for-your-organization/. 

Any thoughts on that? 

Thanks,
MC

PS: Here's our first stab on the internal Singularity how-to: 
https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/Singularity-containers-howtos. Though from 
what I can gather from this group discussions, we'll need to make changes 
when 2.3 comes ;-)
