Hi Jonathan,

Although many sites do install from source on NFS and then use modules to
manage, this is not the recommended approach.  In addition to the issue
with the localstatedir that you point out, there is also a philosophical
issue with supporting multiple versions of Singularity:

Singularity is not a "normal scientific app".  Parts of the code path run
with elevated privs via a setuid bit.  New versions of Singularity often
contain security patches.  If you support legacy Singularity versions you
must pay close attention to which version are safe and which version are
not or else you may be asking for trouble.  It's usually best to only
support the latest version of Singularity.

These are some of the issues that Sylabs <https://www.sylabs.io/> aims to
solve with Singularity Pro.  It's analogous to running Fedora vs RHEL.
Basically, Sylabs has created supported snapshots of the Singularity open
source software that will be supported for the long term with backported
bug fixes and security patches.

Dave
