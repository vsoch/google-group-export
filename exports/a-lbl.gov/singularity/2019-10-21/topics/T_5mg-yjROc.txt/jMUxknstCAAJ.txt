Hi Vanessa,

I understand the granularity of security in the organization on the user 
level (some user having read only permissions, potentially limiting third 
party app access, etc). However, from the link I sent earlier it seemed 
like it's possible to grant the third party app access on the app level, 
not only just blank open it for any app as I have done now to allow SH 
access. So, essentially, now I can only turn third-party app access to all 
the organization repos on or off for any third-party app. What I am after 
is can this be done on a per app basis, e.g. granting it just to SH, and 
not any other third party app?

I am looking forward to 2.3, it should help our users, to build their 
containers on our systems without the need of root. My workaround now was 
to teach them to install Ubuntu VM in Windows or Mac, and there build 
Singularity and the containers, which is not very difficult (after making a 
guideline for it) but still an extra step that many may not want to take.

Thanks,
MC
