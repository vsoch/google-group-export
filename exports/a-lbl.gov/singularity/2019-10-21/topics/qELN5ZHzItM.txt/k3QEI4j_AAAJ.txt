Ahh, that only worked by chance. Singularity is very sensitive to where the
options are for each part of the command. For example:

singularity -v exec container.img python

is not the same as

singularity exec -v contianer.img python

is not the same as

singularity exec container.img python -v

putting --debug at the end, actually randomly was a workaround for this
particular bug only because it was saying if there are no options, dump
usage output. Anyways, now it should be fixed, but let me know if you have
any other problems!

e easy integration to point to / plug into a singularity hub workflow, so p=
erhaps a researcher would just store a file in a github repo somewhere that=
 has a representation of both the data grabbing step and the pointer to a s=
pecific workflow. I want users to be able to re-use the same workflows, on =
different data, with perhaps some option to upload =C2=A0/ return a standar=
d representation of a result, but again, tying a specific data input to a w=
orkflow means that people won&#39;t re-use others workflows, and then we ha=
ve the equivalent of Github today - extreme redundancy with poor organizati=
on and re-use.</span><div><span style=3D"font-size:12.8px"><br></span></div=
><div><span style=3D"font-size:12.8px">@tristan: It&#39;s not an issue of s=
toring the output definition somewhere, but getting it in the first place. =
Right now what seems best is along the lines of what you are suggesting - h=
aving the user define it manually, and then storing in some data structure.=
 Boutiques might be best for this purpose - in which case we would just kee=
p the original json in the database, have the user specify the outputs in a=
n interface, and then update the structure (and make it available also via =
the API).</span></div></div><div class=3D"gmail_extra"><br><div class=3D"gm=
