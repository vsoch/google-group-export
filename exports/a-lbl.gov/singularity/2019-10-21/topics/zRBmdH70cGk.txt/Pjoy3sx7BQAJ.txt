Till,

you can try to do the userspace installation in the %runscript section on 
the container's first invocation, as done here:

https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/Singularity-ubuntu-wine-peakselector

Though in this case the user stack ($APPDIR/wineprefix.tgz) is stored in 
the user space (or here, in "some" fixed space), not the container itself.
