These are great feedback points!! Your wish is my command...

https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io

The "site" served there should re-direct to Singularity Hub, and (in the
future) can be the source of more robust documentation.

I went ahead and added your first issue:

https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/issues/1

Take a look at some of my responses, and let me know what you think of the
ideas. I think that the most reasonable way to start is to add an ability
for a user to specify a list of branches to disable (and build others by
default).
