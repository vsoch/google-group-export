The whole thing will be part of a bigger web service so this additional
image processing service will get requests from some backend infrastructure
and this service besides compute nodes will consist also from a server
(master) that will accept remote requests (e.g. web sockets) and will be
pushing work to a queue to Celery workers. Probably Celery is not
absolutely needed but we want the service to be portable not used only on
HPCs but some other cluster using e.g. Kubernetes and Docker etc.
