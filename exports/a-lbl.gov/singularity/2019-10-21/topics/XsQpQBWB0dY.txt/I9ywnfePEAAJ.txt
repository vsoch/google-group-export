Dear Vanessa,

thanks for your answer. I did some checks yesterday and I think I found my=
=20
mistake. The destination directory was actually a file. The new version of=
=20
a library I installed (compared to the previous) has changed the install=20
directory layout in the new release and I have messed up things. I am able=
=20
to copy file now.=20
In case you find the recipe file=20
at: https://github.com/simoneriggi/caesar_base.git
For some reasons I need to investigate why my builds on shub are always=20
failing but locally I am able to build it.=20

Thanks for your support,

Regards,

Simone=20
