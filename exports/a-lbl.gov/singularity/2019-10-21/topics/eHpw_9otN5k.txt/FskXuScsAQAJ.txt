Gregory,

Thank you, it's nice when there is a fix just waiting to be used!  Yes,=20
that worked, I will now continue with my install and testing.

[root@mach0 ~]# singularity --version
2.1
[root@mach0 ~]# singularity exec -w c7.img touch /var/run/yum.pid
[root@mach0 ~]#

Regards,

Steve
