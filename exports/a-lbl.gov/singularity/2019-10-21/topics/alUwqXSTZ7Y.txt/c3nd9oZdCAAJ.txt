Hello

I built a CentOS v7.4 container using Singularity v2.4 on the host machine 
RHEL v7.3 . If I try "ssh localhost" from the host machine, it connects as 
expected whereas when I try "ssh localhost" in the container , it asks for 
the password. It fails to connect as expected. Can anyone here please help 
to resolve this issue? The Container has *openssh.x86_64 0:7.4p1-13.el7_4 & 
openssh-clients.x86_64 0:7.4p1-13.el7_4* installed.

Appreciate your response! Thank you !
