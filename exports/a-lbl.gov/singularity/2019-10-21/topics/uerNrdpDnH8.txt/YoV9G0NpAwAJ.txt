Hey Stefan,

I think you would want to have apt-get update paired with apt-get install,
because let's say we build an image with these two lines:

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y git

that will be fine for the very first go, because both lines are executed.
But uhoh, we forget vim! Then we change our Dockerfile to be like this:

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y git vim

given that we have the first line cached as a layer, it's not going to do
the install with the update.

If that error goes away when you fix the above, then we can be pretty sure
that was it! If not, then it must be something else (and we should figure
it out). I was testing this out again, and it's interesting that the tar
error happens when you run / shell into the image, but not if you do a
standard create --> import, or pull, even followed by shell. I think this
hints at maybe it being related to the creation of a "on demand /
temporary" container vs an actual one, which I know Greg was working on
recently. Greg - let us know if there is something to test or try.

Yes, happy Sunday!!

Best,

Vanessa

<div dir=3D"ltr">Hey Stefan,<div><br></div><div>I think you would want to h=
ave apt-get update paired with apt-get install, because let&#39;s say we bu=
ild an image with these two lines:</div><div><br></div><div>RUN apt-get upd=
ate</div><div>RUN apt-get install -y git</div><div><br></div><div>that will=
 be fine for the very first go, because both lines are executed. But uhoh, =
we forget vim! Then we change our Dockerfile to be like this:</div><div><br=
></div><div><div>RUN apt-get update</div><div>RUN apt-get install -y git vi=
m</div></div><div><br></div><div>given that we have the first line cached a=
s a layer, it&#39;s not going to do the install with the update.=C2=A0</div=
><div><br></div><div>If that error goes away when you fix the above, then w=
e can be pretty sure that was it! If not, then it must be something else (a=
nd we should figure it out). I was testing this out again, and it&#39;s int=
eresting that the tar error happens when you run / shell into the image, bu=
t not if you do a standard create --&gt; import, or pull, even followed by =
shell. I think this hints at maybe it being related to the creation of a &q=
uot;on demand / temporary&quot; container vs an actual one, which I know Gr=
eg was working on recently. Greg - let us know if there is something to tes=
t or try.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, happy Sunday!!</div><div><br></div>=
