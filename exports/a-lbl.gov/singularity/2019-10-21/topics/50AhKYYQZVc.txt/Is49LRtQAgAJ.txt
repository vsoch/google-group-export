So I came up with an answer to my own question which may be of interest to 
others. I inserted the code below into my bashrc. Once in place, I can edit 
~/sing.txt to contain the path name of a valid singularity image. In this 
way, I can use the same container to launch the jobs as to run them and 
I don't have to worry about what choices in MPI I have available on the 
machine I want to run on. To revert to my normal environment, I can delete 
sing.txt, logout and login.

I think this hack might be of interest to others.

if [ -r $HOME/sing.txt ]
then
    IMAGE=$(cat $HOME/sing.txt)
fi
if [ "$IMAGE" != "" ]
then
    if [ -r "$IMAGE" ]
    then
        if [ "$SINGULARITY_CONTAINER" = "" ]
        then
            exec singularity exec $IMAGE bash --login
        fi
    else
        echo Could not read image file $IMAGE
    fi  
fi
