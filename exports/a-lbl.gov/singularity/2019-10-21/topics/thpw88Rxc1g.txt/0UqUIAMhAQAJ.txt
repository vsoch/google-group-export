Hi Chris,

That is an interesting use-case, but there is some areas to be cautious.
For example, having your home directory physically inside the container
would obviously break portability to any other users and it would require
that to write to your home directory, you would have to mount the container
with `--writable`, which is generally not a good idea.

Does the `-H` option not work for your particular need?

Thanks!
