This was just a hack to check if the idea works in principle, and I=20
understand that such a function needs to be configurable in the cfg file.
I'd prefer a global option, where I don't touch /etc/singularity.conf=20
whenever I add a container to the system.

I'll be offline for the next week.=20
After I return we can discuss and agree on the best way to implement this.
I can do a pull request and try on my own :)
