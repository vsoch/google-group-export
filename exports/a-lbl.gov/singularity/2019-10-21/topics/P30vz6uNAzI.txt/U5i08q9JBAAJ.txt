Hey Kevin and Vanessa,

No actually I'm trying to spitball a bit and see what the community would
like to see when it comes to CI/CD using the Remote Builder
<https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder>.  The Sylabs team has not built any CI/CD
integration with GitHub yet, and we'd like to know what works and what
doesn't.

Singularity Hub really lends itself to a model where there is a single
GitHub repo for every container afaik. And it also expects that each def
file will be named "Singularity".  I'm proposing an alternate idea, where a
GitHub repo has a directory at the top level, (maybe called /.singularity
or /.remotebuilder or something) and there is one or a series of conf files
in that directory (maybe .yaml or .toml files or something) that specify
which files in the repo are are def files, which files need to be copied up
to the remote builder, etc.  Maybe there is also configuration for the type
of hardware you need to build on.  Don't know.  Thoughts?  Ideas?
