I thought about this when I wrote this part (the 'docker' group). The fact
that there is a docker group on your system does not prevent you from the
need of sudo rights to create the singularity container. That is why I
thought, "Ok, this is a script to convert docker to singularity, and you
need at least sudo for the import stuff in singularity, why bother with
docker special permission ?".

BTW, the 'docker'/'dockerroot' group is a special group with sudo rights on
docker command.

If all you want to do is to export your docker container, why trying to
convert it ? Ask your system administrator ;)


Perhaps we can also check if the user is a member of docker* and just warn
him that he won't be able to do the full conversion.

Hum, interesting. :)

As I said, it seems that there is already some kind of compression in the
docker storage.

Yep, nice idea.
