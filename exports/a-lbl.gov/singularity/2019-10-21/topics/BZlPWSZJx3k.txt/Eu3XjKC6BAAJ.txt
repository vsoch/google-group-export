Subject: Re: [Singularity] --nv & nvidia-smi

Glad to hear that it is working with the official tensorflow container.
The only thing that I would recommend when you are building a container to
use the --nv option is this.  You must recognize that cuda, cuDNN, and
other libraries are not the same as the nvidia driver.  This has confused
some users.  You must install cuda, cuDNN and other other libraries that
you plan to use in the container.  This is necessary because software such
as TensorFlow will only work with certain versions of cuda.  So the
libraries must be installed internally to keep the containers portable.  On
the other hand you must not install the nivdia library within the container
as it may conflict with the driver version on the host system.

To get an idea of what kinds of things are bind mounted into the container
from the host system, you can see this config file
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/master/etc/nvliblist.conf>.
NVIDIA is developing an interface called nvidia-container-cli
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/libnvidia-container> that lists the libraries
and binaries on a host system that are needed for a particular type of
application (like compute or graphics).  In the next version of Singularity
we will provide an option to leverage that tool directly to locate libs and
bins in a more intelligent way.  So down the road you will want to install
nvidia-container-cli on your host system.
