It would be nice to let a user choose on the fly, but we have to favor
security. There should be no special needs, library wise, for the Python,
so I don't see a compelling use case to want to use your own. The only
reasonable option I see here is having it be a custom setting when
Singularity is installed (with sudo) in the first place.
