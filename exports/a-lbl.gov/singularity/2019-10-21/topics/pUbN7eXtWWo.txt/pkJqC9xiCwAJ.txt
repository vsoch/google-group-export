Hi everyone,

I am planning some really awesome stuff for Supercomputing this year in
Denver and going to need your help! As you know, we are an open source
project, and thus budgets are tight, so to make the biggest bang for the
buck, I am going to order massive quantities of stickers, swag, shirts, and
stuff still yet to be decided, and since we don't have a booth, we will
need help giving all of this away!

Volunteers, as many as we can get, to be representatives of the Singularity
project, and help distribute this stuff as well as answer questions to
people about Singularity. Additionally, there has been interest by vendors
to sponsor an event, so we also have invitations to hand out!

You don't have to be an expert in the project, or even a contributor to
join! You just need to be friendly, able to carry lots of swag to hand out,
wear a shirt or a pin about being on the "Singularity Squad" (is that too
corny?), and be present at the expo!

Lastly, we need shirt and pin designs using the Singularity logo so let's
have a competition! The only rules are don't modify the Singularity logo,
and feel free to include any other graphics, words/text, something funny
preferred and the decision will be based on plurality vote by the
"Singularity Squad" (as it will be us handing out the shirts and wearing
them!).

So, if you are going to be at SC, and if you want to help the project, join
the Singularity Squad!

BTW, I will also need help managing this, if anyone on this list enjoys
this sort of thing. :)

Let's have some fun at Supercomputing this year!
