Just wanted to provide you with an update on this post. =20

For this workflow to run Monte Carlo simulations, the users use a software=
=20
that containerize a working environment by using mount points namespaces. =
=20
At that time, in 2013, they wanted their needed execution scripts and=20
environment settings for their workflow to assume a "fixed directory=20
location" for major Monte Carlo components, so the developer at that time=
=20
decided to setup a 'fake' environment by using namespaces to see whatever=
=20
needed filesystem at thought it was installed in the common root directory=
=20
used in the defined environment. =20

Their workflow do this:

bash script --call-- C binary --use-- sudo for mount points namespaces=20
--spawn-- shell --do-- compile/editing/PBS job submission/local job=20
submission

I got with the C code and was able to identify what was done by both the=20
bash script and the C code.  Long story short here, we will replace the=20
bash script to launch a Singularity container as it can bind the required *=
working=20
environment *as the *desired fixed directory location*, so then they can=20
do: compile/editing/PBS job submission/local job submission.  Again, the=20
idea was to reproduce via Singularity containers what they currently do on=
=20
CentOS6 based systems as we are moving into CentOS7.

Thanks for all help, really appreciated!

You could write a wrapper script called =E2=80=9Csudo=E2=80=9D that uses =
=E2=80=9Cfakeroot=E2=80=9D, which is a mature implementation of this. Don=
