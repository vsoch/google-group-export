Great question, and one that we are working on right now... There is the
ability for some standards to be implemented such that scratch is always
mounted at /scratch, and home directories are always mounted at /home, but
that isn't a great solution in my opinion. The better solution would be for
paths to be freeform and created within the container as necessary. But,
the features necessary to do that require a very recent kernel (not even
RHEL7 has a full implementation of overlayfs, but they have enough for us
to do it).

And we are working on that now and will be part of 2.2!... But again, if
you are running anything less then a very recent kernel/distro, it won't
work. :(

Thanks!
