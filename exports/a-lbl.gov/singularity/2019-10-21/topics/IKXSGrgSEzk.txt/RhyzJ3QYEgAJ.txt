Happy new year, dear Singularity-community,

 I am asking those of you using the MPI Hybrid mode with OpenMPI 2 for 
sharing your experience.
What does the hybrid approach do for you that cannot be done by having MPI 
within the container?

We offer a large collection of software suites with various different MPI 
version on our site.
To my understanding the hybrid approach is great if you utilize one OpenMPI 
version mainly.

Use cases I can think of are
- Easily run multi-node containers provided the hybrid MPI version supports 
fast interconnects
- Containers can have MPI excluded entirely
- Container may utilize either its containerized MPI or a unified MPI 
provided by the cluster environment

So...If you use hybrid MPI - what are your motivations to do so?

Stefan
