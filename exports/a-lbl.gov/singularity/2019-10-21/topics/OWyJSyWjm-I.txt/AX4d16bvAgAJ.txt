Subject: Re: [Singularity] Celery RabbitMQ worker packaged in a Singularity container

Frontend server probably using Flask yes will authenticate the user using
calls to existing backend so this part is taken care of. After sucessfull
authentication I would like to send task to the task queue (celery) and one
of the predefinied and started gpu workers that would run on separate nodes
using Singularity would take the job, execute it and send the results back
to the frontend server which would deliver result back to the backend. So
my only concern was if networking in Singularity supports this kind of idea
( running container as a Celery worker - tcp connection to some remote
queue, that maybe will also run as a Singularity container). Basically is
this possible?

r with celery will do the number of cores available, but you can also set i=
t to be something different (eg celery -A myproject worker --concurrency=3D=
10...). For Singularity you would want to have your image, and then have a =
startscript for it, and have the startscript be this celery command to star=
t up the (concurrent) workers.</div><div><br></div><div>I would start out d=
