Thanks Greg and Vanessa for the replies. I'll try the Singularity Hub 
(after I rearrange my github repo), and, indeed, the container build stops 
at an error when using the development branch. That's great, thanks.

Though, I have hit another error that is somewhat bizarre. When this is 
included in the %post section of the container:
pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
then the container build crashes on this line, but, if I shell into the 
container afterwards, the "pip install" works.
The error is the same as described here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37495375/python-pip-install-throws-typeerror-unsupported-operand-types-for-retry
which makes me suspect some kind of networking issue, 

Note that Singularity version 2.2.1 does not produce this error.

So, my question would be - in the development version, is there a 
difference in the %post section, as compared to the container shell, with 
respect to networking?

On a side note, when trying to debug this, I put
env | grep proxy

in the %post section, and, Singularity did not like this much either:
+ env
+ grep proxy
ERROR: Aborting with RETVAL=255

That happens both with the devel and with 2.2.1. Any thoughts on this?

Thanks,
MC
