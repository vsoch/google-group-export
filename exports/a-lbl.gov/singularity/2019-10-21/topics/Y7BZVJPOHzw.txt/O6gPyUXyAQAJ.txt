Packages for singularity (2.0 plus some patches) have now hit the Fedora
-testing repositories for EPEL5 through to Fedora 24 beta.  Use
"--enablerepo \*-testing install singularity" with yum or dnf.

If you have a suitable account, please report issues that might be
packaging-related in RH bugzilla or bodhi.  Otherwise, mail me if you
quite reasonably don't see why you should create an account to file an
issue against something.

The packaging is under
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/singularity.git/tree/ if anyone
wants to port it to SuSE etc. or if Greg wants to adjust the bundled
spec.  Unfortunately Fedora rules don't allow conditional support for
other distributions, but it's sometimes possible to fiddle that.
