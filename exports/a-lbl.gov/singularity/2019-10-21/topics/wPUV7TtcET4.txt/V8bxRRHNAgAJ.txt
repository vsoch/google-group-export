I think Remy has hit the nail on the head here.

I am not going to express myself very well here, but in general does this
point up the need for some 'good practice' guidelines
for installing Python (or other similar)  packages within containers?
Ie something like, very crudely:
Create a directory called /apps/python
Put your virtualenv there
