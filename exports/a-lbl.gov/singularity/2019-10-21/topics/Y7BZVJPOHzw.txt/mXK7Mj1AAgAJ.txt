The EPEL version is only relevant for el/epel systems (in Fedora
technology), i.e. RHEL-ish distributions.  (Good point about installing
epel-release, which I tend to assume everyone has.)  The dnf version is
specifically for Fedora releases; I gather there's a dnf in either RHEL7
or epel7 which you don't want to use.  You could use "updates-testing"
specifically in the Fedora recipe.

It will need amending, probably in a couple of weeks or so, when the
packages get to stable.

I've found that the change to bootstrap with dnf for Fedora fails trying
to write /var/log/dnf.log.  I don't immediately understand why, and will
back out part of one change for now.  Change forthcoming for "upstream",
of course.

While we're on the same page, should it include building dpkg from
source?
