Oh goodness, these are all great ideas but most are outside my reach (with
the exception of GPUs). So, I ask for help... Can people either send the
question and answer to me, and I will throw it into the FAQ, or send me a
GitHub pull request that has the updates?

With that said, I will work on the GPU question and will fix the typos
related to Flatpak.

Thanks!!
