Can you elaborate on this please?

At present, I am checking the return code for success/fail on pretty much
every system and function call passed. Please let me/us know if any were
missed! As you know, I am completely open and supportive of patches, fixes
and updates!

I went through each of the flawfinder warnings, and fixed a massive amount
of what it found and commented on almost all of the others that were a
severity greater then 1. Again, help is wanted and I'm sure everyone on the
list would be appreciative!

Send them up! :)

If you don't have the time, whatever pointers you can provide would be
helpful.

Thanks!
