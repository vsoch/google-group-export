Yeah,

So doing a create and then import seems to fix that build error.

So I would have to agree, that it might have something to do with the run 
and shell commands not creating a large enough image to begin with. 
Although as you say, I have no idea what is actually going on behind the 
scenes there.

Thanks for your help

Chris
