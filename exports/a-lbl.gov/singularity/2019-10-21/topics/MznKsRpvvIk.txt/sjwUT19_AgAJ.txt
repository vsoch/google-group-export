Hey Ivo,

In Popper, singularity is supported natively, so you can define an action

has singularity I'm good to go. This works for some use cases, but I'm

testing a container in some CI, I'd want to (do similar to GitHub actions)
and be able to specify a container URI to build in (so I don't need to
build freshly).

That's super awesome! I think the distinction is that (typically) GitHub
actions docker images are used as bases, and the user (does something
inside) that would warrant needing write. If there was a kind of
Singularity build with a bind to allow write, that would be logical! I
haven't tried it, so I'm just thinking out loud.

https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-ci Good thing that the other
services work really well, most of us are happy campers until Actions is
out of beta.

> action "Build" {
>   uses =3D "docker://singularityware/singularity:3.1.1-slim"

And it worked!!! The output paths are also relative to the .git repo, so
I'd actually need to also do:

action "Build" {
>   uses =3D "docker://singularityware/singularity:3.1.1-slim"
>   args =3D "build popper/container.sif popper/Singularity"
> }


What are the rules w.r.t the location of main.workflow? For example, since
this wouldn't work on GitHub, I removed the main.workflow from the .github
folder, and am storing it in a popper folder. What are "best practices" for
how these files should be organized in a repo, given that sometimes we want
them to run via actions (and others not?) And what is suggested practice
for integrating other services - using popper to generate separate configs,
or just using popper run?

Technically, yes, for (most) Singularity commands (other than like, pull)
you would need priviledged. Honestly, I don't think I would suggest doing
this - my computer has crashed suddenly too many times and I wouldn't
encourage it. But the "build a Singularity container with Docker" is a
small subset of use cases - I see it more likely that users would be happy
to use Docker containers as bases for other operations that don't require
the same escalation of privileges. For example, here is a trivial recipe to
use a container base, write a file to it, and run:

workflow "Salad" {
>   on =3D "push"
>   resolves =3D "Make Salad"
> }
> action "Arbitrary Write" {
>   uses =3D "docker://vanessa/salad"
>   runs =3D "touch"
>   args =3D "/greens.txt"
> }
> action "Make Salad" {
>   needs =3D "Arbitrary Write"
>   uses =3D "docker://vanessa/salad"
> }


This runs okay - although (I think?) the steps are isolated - if I write
some file in "Arbitrary Write" it's stuck in the container (this is why
GitHub binds the github workspace
<https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-github-actions/accessing-the=
-runtime-environment/#filesystem>
- could we do that too here? I'd want to be able to share results between
steps, eg.,

workflow "Salad" {
>   on =3D "push"
>   resolves =3D "Make Salad"
> }
> action "Arbitrary Write" {
>   uses =3D "docker://vanessa/salad"
>   runs =3D "touch"
>   args =3D "/greens.txt"
> }
> action "List" {
>   needs =3D "Arbitrary Write"
>   uses =3D "docker://vanessa/salad"
>   runs =3D "ls"
>   args =3D "/"
> }
> action "Make Salad" {
>   needs =3D "List"
>   uses =3D "docker://vanessa/salad"
> }


So when I run it, it should include /greens.txt in the listing:

$ popper run
>
> [Arbitrary Write] docker pull vanessa/salad
>
> [Arbitrary Write] docker create vanessa/salad /greens.txt
>
> [Arbitrary Write] docker start
>
> [List] docker pull vanessa/salad
>
> [List] docker create vanessa/salad /
>
> [List] docker start
>
> bin
>
> code
>
> dev
>
> etc
>
> home
>
>  ... (truncated)

> var

> [Make Salad] docker pull vanessa/salad
>
> [Make Salad] docker create vanessa/salad
>
> [Make Salad] docker start
>
>
>>  You're done!
>
> =E2=8E=AF=E2=8E=AF=E2=88=88
>

>>
>
Just a quick note - .git is required? Is there any reason to require it
(and not give a warning instead?) For example, here is an empty folder
where I want to test a workflow (no .git) - I'm not able to.

$ cd /tmp/test/
> vanessa@vanessa-ThinkPad-T460s:/tmp/test$ popper run
> ERROR: Unable to find root of a Git repository.


I can try to git init quickly, but it's not a real repo and not happy - I
had to artificially copy an entire .git tree there to just test.

Anyway thanks for the cool tool, I'm having a lot of fun! I think it would
be good to keep working on these use cases. I'll do more thinking too!

Best,

Vanessa

 (most) Singularity commands (other than like, pull) you would need privile=

has crashed suddenly too many times and I wouldn&#39;t encourage it. But th=
e &quot;build a Singularity container with Docker&quot; is a small subset o=
f use cases - I see it more likely that users would be happy to use Docker =
containers as bases for other operations that don&#39;t require the same es=
calation of privileges. For example, here is a trivial recipe to use a cont=
ainer base, write a file to it, and run:</div><div><br></div><div><blockquo=
