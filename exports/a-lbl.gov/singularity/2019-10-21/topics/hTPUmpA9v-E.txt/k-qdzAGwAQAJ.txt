Many thanks for this insight! 

From the code I deduce I should set "SINGULARITY_TMPDIR" to override the folder to contain the temporary files. 

However, looking at other parts of singularity, I find: 
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/e480d9640f5e76a51af7a9f43e87b77f008f6652/libexec/handlers/image-docker.sh#L13
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/e480d9640f5e76a51af7a9f43e87b77f008f6652/libexec/handlers/archive-tar.sh#L16
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/e480d9640f5e76a51af7a9f43e87b77f008f6652/libexec/handlers/archive-cpio.sh#L15

So this variable seems to be used internally in some cases? And then it's actually derived from SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR, or in one case even SINGULARY_LOCALCACHEDIR?

Is this wild mixup just a set of bugs I should all file as issues? 

This overview of environment variables would be really good to have, since it seems even the developers don't have a clean consistent idea of which variable should be used for what - 
or I am misreading the code ;-). 
For us users, it would be cool to just have one defined way to specify a cache directory (for persistent stuff) and a tmp-directory (for non-persistent stuff) singularity should use... 

Cheers, 
	Oliver
