Hello,

I'm looking to build a singularity image from a docker base image that has 
a hardcoded username in the Dockerfile. When using docker, it isn't a 
problem; I can just do work in container as this hardcoded user. However, 
my impression on reading about singularity is that only files installed in 
a user-agnostic way will work. So, is there a way to specify user id and/or 
username mapping when constructing a singularity image based upon a docker 
image that has software installed for a specific hardcoded user (including 
mapping /home/harcoded_user to the appropriate place in singularity, for 
instance)?

I do have the ability to change the Dockerfile, if that helps, but the 
software installed in the docker base image assumes and requires a specific 
non-root user.

Best,
