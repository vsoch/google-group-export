Renato,

If you're having problems with `--writeable` or `--sandbox` please report 
them @ https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues and we'll definitely 
take a look. Those should be working even though we went through a complete 
code re-write.

In general, 3.X should work with 2.X containers. 2.X will *not* work with 
3.X containers.

Let me know if you have questions or need help opening the issue.

Thanks!

Justin
