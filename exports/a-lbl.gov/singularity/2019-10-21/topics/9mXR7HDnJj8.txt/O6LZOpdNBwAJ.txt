Hi Jack,

Apologies again that it isn't working automatically. We are working through
it now and I've let our team know.

You mentioned your HPC group is working on a local build service? I wonder
if it makes sense for them to discuss with us our "Singularity Enterprise"
offering which includes a build service, public key store for
cryptographically verifying containers and provenance, and a container
hosting library; basically the Sylabs cloud to run on-prem.

Thank you!
Greg
