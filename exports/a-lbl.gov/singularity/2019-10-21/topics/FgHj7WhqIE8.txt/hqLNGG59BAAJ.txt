As I already mentioned in the Singularity Slack channel: I (heavily) 
support Lars' view on this.

Both Singularity 2.4.6 and 2.5.0 were announced late Friday 
afternoon/evening CEST, which basically rules out quickly reacting to 
the announcement.
A lot of sites are quite careful to deploying changes on a Friday (let 
alone over the weekend) to avoid unintended/unwanted side effects that 
affect production.

I understand your point of view, but I think you can argue both ways on 
this...
It's hard to be sure which approach is better, but my gut feeling tells 
me that a public announcement is likely to draw more attention, and thus 
may (slightly) increase the risk of exploiting known security bugs when 
they're disclosed at a bad time. Projects like OpenSSL know this well I 
think, I've certainly noticed them paying attention to it.

Please consider announcing these similar releases in the future at a 
different time of the week, e.g. early/mid working week week (Mon-Wed 
makes sense I think), and preferably with a pre-announcement of an 
upcoming release a couple of days up front (so that the update can be 
planned).

In addition, I think it would be great if a separate 
announcement/security mailing list could be created for Singularity, 
which is low traffic.
That way, people/sites can subscribe only/also to that, so that security 
(pre-)announcements pop into view as soon they are made (rather than 
being buried in a folder that is only checked once in a while due to 
heavier traffic).


regards,

Kenneth
