Yes, you granted permissions to singularity hub, and will be asked for all
future 3rd party applications. Granting to Shub does not open up some
gateway for any third party application access to your repos. Does that
make sense? Poke around these docs --> https://help.github.com/
articles/about-third-party-application-restrictions/
