At Stanford, to open source something, the office just directs you to read
about the different license options:

"The University does not make any particular recommendations as to which

I'm not sure how "permission of your employer" maps onto academia - asking
our advisor for permission?  Most advisors don't micromanage graduate
students, and I find it hard to think that one would say "no, definitely
not" unless doing such work interfered with the research goals of the
student.

A big portion (namely, mostly all of it) of code/tools that are developed
in an academic environment are some flavor of open source. Most of us don't
really have a sense of what that means, legally but generally, the culture
that I see (and like) is one of openly sharing code, data, and worrying
less about being scooped, getting credit, etc. Now that I think of it,
credit/licensing probably happens on the level of publication. I'm probably
deviant in this thinking, but if someone can take something that I've done
and do something better with it, I think maybe they should, and I can move
on to other things. It seems best to try and make good tools, encourage
anyone and everyone to use, and this means minimal legal stuffs. This is
why I put an MIT license on most things :)

I'd be happy to do whatever you suggest / need for LBNL, since I don't like
to spend too much time thinking about these things. I will continue
developing things that are badly needed, regardless.

You _must_ have the permission of your employer to contribute to an open so=
