Just wanted to thank you for pushing this along! Haven't seen others 
respond to your ongoing efforts, but wanted you to know it's very 
helpful to a lot of us.

After enough karma has been achieved or the required time has elapsed
(2 weeks for epel, 1 week for fedora), I will promote this version to
stable.  

Since there can be only one version at a time in the testing yum
repository, my plan is to wait to build singularity-3.2.0 for epel until
3.1.1-1.1 is promoted.

My main mistake was requesting the update last week, then having to
revoke that and re-push to testing when I realized it was too early.
That reset the clock for 14 days.  I didn't notice the mistake until
today, and in the meanwhile ended up resetting the clock again for el6.
I could promote el7 next week, but I think it would be better to do them
both the same time.

I also asked for and just obtained permission from the EPEL board to
update it in EPEL, and so will be announcing soon that it is in
