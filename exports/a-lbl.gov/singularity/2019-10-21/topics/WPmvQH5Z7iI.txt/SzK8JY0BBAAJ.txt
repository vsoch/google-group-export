I have a job I am running in singularity that parses command line arguments 
such as file paths.  As I do not control the files being fed into the job, 
it is possible that the path may have a space in it.  Normally I would 
handle this by surrounding the variables in question with either double or 
single quotes, but when I have tried this from the singularity UI, it 
appears that my quotes are not respected and the spaces are consumed.  Is 
this a known error?  Or is there an easy way around this?  My job is 
written in java reading args from stdin.
