Hi,

After reading documentation and FAQ, I saw this :
http://singularity.lbl.gov/faq#can-a-singularity-container-be-suspended-or-check-pointed

However, this means that the checkpoint method is included in the software
design. As an HPC system administrator, you generally have to install
applications but you do not have a deep knowledge (or even the permission
or the sources) of each app, except for those you code yourself.

For some containers technologies, there is the possibility to use CRIU, ie :
