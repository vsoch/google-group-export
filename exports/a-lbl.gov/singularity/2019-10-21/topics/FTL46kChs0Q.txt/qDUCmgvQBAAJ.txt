Robin,

I closed out all the windows and am now on a different computer, but I
believe in the case where I wanted root and to su as a regular user, I
had to explicitly add -B /home to the singularity command, but then it
worked.

Nope, not at all.  Just trying to get the facts straight.

Yes.  Precisely.  I think there is an advantage to that.  Does this
scenario make sense?  I create a container in a VM on my laptop where
I have root.  I grab my passwd/group entries from the system on which
I which I wish to use it and add them to the container.  I chown
/usr/local in the container to my HPC user.  I copy the container to
the HPC environment.  I can now, as myself, copy files into the
container from the host environment (maybe libraries), I can run
compilations fully inside the container (I see many people with
software that need to recompile a Fortran library to change the
parameters of their model, for example).  In short, I can set up the
container in such a way that I can work inside the container and
interact with the host system in ways that might otherwise require
root.

For example, Spack could be set up to run as the regular user from
inside the container, but install to /usr/local instead of the user's
host home directory, maybe?

You're absolutely right about that.  I had forgot that he wanted to
alternate and instead tried to forge ahead to a configuration that
might fulfill the same purposes without the alternation being
necessary.  Sorry for not making that clearer.

I took no offense; hope none given.

This is mostly a thought-experiment anyway, but it might be useful to
someone, somewhere, sometime.
