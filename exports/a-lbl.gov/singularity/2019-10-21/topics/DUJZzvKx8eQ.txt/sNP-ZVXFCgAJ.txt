Another advantage of adopting the OCI Image spec is that soon repositories
such as docker hub and quay will start distributing compatible images. It
would be great if a singularity user could download such image from one of
those repositories and run it (without needing root access to convert it to
Singularity .img).

@Vanessa: have a look at https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/freesurfer or
https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/example.

Best,
Chris
