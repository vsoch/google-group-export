First I wanted to let people know that I have created a DOI number for
Singularity via Zenodo (thanks Chris!!!). If you are publishing a
scientific paper and leveraged Singularity in some shape or form, you can
cite Singularity v2.1.2 here:

https://zenodo.org/record/60736#.V73aQpMrK25

Also, if you have Singularity installed or have it installed on a
provider's system, I would be very interested to be able to cite that for
internal use (use-cases for management are always good). This is very
important for resource justification, so please take a few moments to
provide me the following (privately):

Please send me the following:

* Organization Name
* URL of organization
* Cluster Name (if possible)
* Size of cluster
* Types of science (or indicate for general use)
* Can I mention this system publicly (e.g. presentations, website, etc.)

Thank you!
