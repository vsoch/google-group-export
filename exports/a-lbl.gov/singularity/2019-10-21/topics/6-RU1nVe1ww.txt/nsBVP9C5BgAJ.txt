Carla, Peter,   this is an interesting discussion.
Note that Dave Godlove recently posted a very good item on the advantages
of Singularity, including the fact that the launch time for highly parallel
Python applications is lowered for basically the same reasons.

When one is doing disk benchmarking it is usual to use the flag which says
'make sure this data is flushed to disk'
for instance  -o fsync when using dd  - I forget the flag with ior
Anyway, your remarks make me think - with a bind mount when DOES the
operating system call return that 'yes - this data has been written'

A complete aside here also. I used to manage SGI NUMA systems with a
terabyte of memory and more, with filesystems directly connected by
fibrechannel.
I was always advised by SGI to set the OS tunings to flush data to disk
aggressively ie the dirty_ration and dirty flush centisecs etc.
A Linus system will cache writes in RAM as much as it can, and you really
dont want to find out that if a power cut happens that you have a terabyte
of dirty data which has just disappeared.
Modern systems are getting up to that level of RAM for single systems, so
be aware of this.

Dear all,<br>

I am following this discussion with high interest.<br>
<br>
Does that mean that every i/o call inside the container is cached in or goi=

<br>
If there is any docs on this, I&#39;d be happy to see through it. The reaso=
