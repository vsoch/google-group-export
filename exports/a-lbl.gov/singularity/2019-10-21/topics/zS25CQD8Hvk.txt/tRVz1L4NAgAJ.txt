Hi Josep,

These are great questions!  Thanks for asking them. =20

Us folks at Sylabs have been shy to talk about ourselves in forums like=20
this with the open source community.   Singularity is an open-source=20
project that belongs to the community, and we at Sylabs see ourselves as=20
members of that community and contributors to the larger community-owned=20
effort.  But it seems that our shyness has led to some confusion as well. =
=20
So maybe now is a good time to give some background.=20

SingularityWare was a temporary LLC that Greg set up to hold the=20
Singularity source code and ensure that it stays open source while he=20
transitioned out of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.  Sylabs=20
<https://www.sylabs.io/> is the company that Greg founded to support,=20
develop, and maintain Singularity and associated projects.  As Vanessa=20
points out, she created some projects under the singularityware=20
<https://github.com/singularityware> GitHub group (which was named for the=
=20
LLC) before Sylabs became a company, and they remain there where she=20
continues to develop them.  We are happy to keep the singularityware GitHub=
=20
available, and also, host projects under Sylabs organization for visibility=
=20
and direct association to the project. Whatever you guys want, we are here=
=20
to provide!

It is also worth mentioning that every single bit of Singularity=20
development carried out by Sylabs is, and will always be, open source. =20
Since Jan 1, Sylabs has completely re-written Singularity and has released=
=20
3.0 <https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases>.  We=E2=80=99ve also d=
eveloped=20
cloud services for a Container Library <https://cloud.sylabs.io/library>, R=
emote=20
Builder <https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder>, and Keystore=20
<https://cloud.sylabs.io/keystore> for trusted container creation and=20
distribution.  These services are available for checking out as an early=20
alpha technology preview.
=20
While we don=E2=80=99t often talk about our commercial offerings at Sylabs =
in open=20
source forums, sometimes it is good to share our intentions.  Open source=
=20
development can be quite costly to create and maintain, and this is where=
=20
Sylabs comes in.  You can think of SingularityPRO as being to Singularity=
=20
what RHEL is to Fedora.  Stable, secure, long-term support vs. bleeding=20
edge open source.  SingularityPRO allows for an easy way to install=20
Singularity via RPM (now) or deb (coming soon).  Specific releases of=20
Singularity (like 2.6) are marked for long-term support and receive=20
backported bug-fixes and features once they are deemed stable in the open=
=20
source version.  SingularityPRO subscribers also get advanced access to=20
security patches=20
<https://www.sylabs.io/2018/06/sylabs-security-vulnerability-protocol/>. =
=20
The Sylabs cloud services mentioned above is a freemium service, and=20
SingularityPRO subscribers will get unfettered access.  Finally,=20
SingularityPRO subscribers get access to support directly from Singularity=
=20
developers. If you run Singularity in a mission critical, production=20
environment, we would love to talk to you about SingularityPRO.


Hopefully, that clears things up for you and for other community members=20
with similar questions.  We=E2=80=99d be happy to discuss further!  Please =
feel=20
free to reach out to myself directly, or contact the company through the=20
front door at: he...@sylabs.io.

Dave
