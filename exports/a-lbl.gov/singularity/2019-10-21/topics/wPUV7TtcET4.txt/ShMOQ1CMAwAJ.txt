Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity and "development mode" python package
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hello,

Today I tried again to sort this out.
What I did:
- create a virtualenv inside the container: I did not find out how to
activate it a runtime with a normal user
- set PYTHONPATH inside the container: no change
- run singularity with the '-H' option: It works!

However, it would be nice if there was a way in the bootstrap
instructions to make sure that the container is always separated from
local python packages in the HOME directory of the user.

Regards,
Laurent
