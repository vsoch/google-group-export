I have some plans, fixes and ideas for this:

1. In the newest development work we are doing, a user can create an image
and import to that image as non root. That makes this possible:
`singularity create tensorflow.img; singularity import tensorflow.img
docker://tensorflow:latest` without being root. note: This does not work
for bootstrapping, only importing.

2. Singularity Hub (and/or DockerHub) can be used to build images today.
Singularity Hub (shub) integrates with ones GitHub repository, and using
continuous integration, will generate a new container that you can then
reference via `singularity shell shub://....`.

3. I have a vision for a build service (that has yet to be built). The
build service would integrate directly with Singularity and allow someone
to remote build a container using the generalized bootstrap syntax as we
use now. For example: `singularity bootstrap-remote container.img
file.def`. that command would send the file.def to a build server, and
would wait until the build server was done, at which point it would
download the resultant container.img. For all practical purposes, the build
process could have been local.

This is what the OverlayFS feature is supposed to mitigate. In 2.2 it was
not enabled by default (as it tickled a bug in RH7's kernel), but that bug
has been fixed, and it is now enabled in the development versions. If you
want to test it, search for 'overlay' in the singularity.conf, and enable
it.

BTW, you are 100% correct though about the practice of making portable
containers. I usually recommend for people to build completely with a
bootstrap definition (recipe) for this reason, but even then, there are
some best practices which must be followed! And before they can be
followed.... they should be written! haha
