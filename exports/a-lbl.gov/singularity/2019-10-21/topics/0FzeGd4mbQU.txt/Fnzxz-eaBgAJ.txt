Hi,=20
Thanks for your answer. I also tried that. Still the problem persists with=
=20
CentOS 6 hosts. With Singularity 2.2.1 and the create command it builds the=
=20
image, but when I try to run it, still says:=20

ERROR  : Container does not have a valid /bin/sh
ABORT  : Retval =3D 255

But when I try with Singularity 2.4.6 or 2.6.0, the build fails, saying:

User defined %runscript found! Taking priority.
Running post scriptlet
FATAL: kernel too old
ABORT: Aborting with RETVAL=3D255

I had already seen these kernel too old messages in CentOS 6 hosts.

Thanks!

<br>&gt; Hello,
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; I&#39;m starting to work with Singularity and still don&#39;t know=
 all the details, so this may be something obvious, but I couldn&#39;t find=
 the answer on my own. I am trying to use the gnuplot container built with =
this description file:
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; BootStrap: docker
<br>&gt; From: ubuntu:latest
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; %post
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0sed -i &#39;/xenial.*universe/s/^#//g&#39; /etc/apt/s=
ources.list
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0apt-get -y update
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0apt-get -y install gnuplot xorg flashplugin-installer
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; I want to use it in both a CentOS 6 and a CentOS 7 host. In CentOS=
 7 everything goes well. However in CentOS 6 I get:
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; ERROR =C2=A0: No valid /bin/sh in container
<br>&gt; ABORT =C2=A0: Retval =3D 255
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; And similar messages, with versions 2.6.0, 2.4.6 and 2.2.1 of Sing=
ularity. This lack of /bin/sh is something I have seen when creating other =
containers, not just for this gnuplot. In the CentOS 7 host I used just ver=
sion 2.6.0 of Singularity and it worked with no problem. Maybe I did someth=
ing wrong when creating the containers for the older versions of Singularit=
y, 2.4.6 and 2.2.1, but I couldn&#39;t find documentation for these version=
s, only for 2.5 and 2.6. It seems the build command doesn&#39;t exist in th=
ese older versions, and maybe I&#39;m using &quot;create&quot; wrongly.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Has anybody experienced something similar?
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Thank you!
