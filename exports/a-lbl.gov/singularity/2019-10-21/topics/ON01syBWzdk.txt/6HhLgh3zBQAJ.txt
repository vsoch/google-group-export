Questions:

1. Why does the user have to put anything in their submit file? All we do i=
n OMPI is check the file type, and if it is =E2=80=9Csingularity=E2=80=9D, =
then treat it accordingly - which really means doing nothing more than pref=
acing the container name with the =E2=80=9Csingularity=E2=80=9D command.

2. Why does Slurm care if it is a container or not? Either way, it is just =
an executable so far as the scheduler is concerned, and in a batch script, =
putting =E2=80=9Csingularity=E2=80=9D in front of your image seems a pretty=
 trivial thing to do.
