Hi Felix,

If the bootstrap failed, I'd guess that we are likely dealing with an
incomplete / broken image in some way. Could you test if this same bug
occurs when the bootstrap does not fail? Eg: create an image large enough
for the bootstrap, then expand, then check that the metrics would be as you
expect. I haven't used expand a lot, but I can attest that trying to use an
image after a failed bootstrap has given me some strange errors in the past=
.

Something that I've found helpful for estimating the size needed for an
image is building into a folder first.
<https://asciinema.org/a/103492?speed=3D2>

Let us know if the error persists, and we can look into reproducing it! If
the error does persist, or you want to see what's up with the failed
bootstrap --> expand, then you can add --debug to the command to see the
full message for what is going wrong.

Best,

Vanessa
