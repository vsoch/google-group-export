Hi all,

I am trying to use Singularity on a HPC cluster compute node where the root 
filesystem is mounted via NFS. In particular, "/usr/bin" is served via NFS. 
When I run a shell within the container, I observe some really weird 
behavior. If I run `/usr/bin/mkdir`, I get a segmentation fault. I suspect 
that is because `/usr/bin/mkdir` refers to the binary in the host and it's 
pretty old. However, `ls -l /usr/bin/ | grep mkdir` returns nothing. I 
can't find any `mkdir` inside /usr/bin/`! Normally, if I just type `mkdir`, 
`ls`, etc. in the shell, everything is fine. However, when these commands 
appear in a Makefile, I will get a segfault because somehow these commands 
got resolved to the old binaries that belong to the host. Another way to 
trigger the segfault is running `env mkdir` even though `which mkdir` 
returns `/bin/mkdir`.

Has anyone seen anything like this before? Any suggestion? What more 
information can I collect to help debug this problem? Thanks!

Best regards,
Yilong
