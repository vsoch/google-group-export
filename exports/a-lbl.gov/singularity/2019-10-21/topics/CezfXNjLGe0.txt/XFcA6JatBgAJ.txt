your error still has to do with the version of libcuda.so you are using. No=
tice how Python seems to correctly load libcuda.so, yet there is later an e=
rror that is unable to find libcuda.so. My first suspicion is that there is=
 still a version mismatch between the drivers installed on the image and on=
 the host. If you are sure that is not true, it may be possible that the ve=
rsion of the driver that is installed on the machine isn&#39;t new enough f=
or the GPU. That actually occurred on our cluster, and after a sysadmin upd=
ated the driver, it worked. Barring that I am not too sure. Maybe if you pr=
ovide me with the full details of your installation (the versions of the pa=
ckages that you have installed, the OS of your image and host), I might be =
able to think about something, but my suspicion is that the driver version =
on your host machine may not be new enough.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>=
