I don't know much about Ubuntu/Debian. But regarding the Red Hat family, it 
seems to me that libexec/bootstrap/modules-v2/build-redhat.sh would need to

change
   echo "gpgcheck=0" >> "$SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/$YUM_CONF"
to
   echo "gpgcheck=1" >> "$SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/$YUM_CONF"

And a collection of known CentOS/Red Hat/Scientific Linux public GPG keys 
would have to be exist in some temporary file; from that temporary file, 
something like
  rpm --import <tmpfilename>
would need to be run before the 'eval "$INSTALL_CMD...' step?

I may try to gather a collection of such public keys.
But it seems somewhat cumbersome to have to create a potentially large 
temporary pub-key file using echo commands. Is there another way to 
transport data into the image while it's being bootstrapped?
