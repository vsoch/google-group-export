I'm still a bit confused by the boxes-within-boxes aspects of Singulartity.

My image contains a perl and samtools executables in locations that are in 
$PATH. I want perl to be able to execute samtools. Specifically,

In a directory that is bound in the image, there is a perl script, 
myscript.pl, which contains:

```
my $cmd = 'samtools view ...';
my result = `$cmd`;
```

In a script running under Slurm I execute perl:

```
singularity exec my.img  -B ... perl /path/to/myscript.pl
```

The samtools command within the perl script fails to execute. I have also 
tried using the full path to samtools with the same failure.

What do I need to do to make this pattern work?
