Interesting, so this is definitely something to do with the Singularity
build process - you can actually use the same base (from Docker) and not
run into any of these issues. Here is a starter Dockerfile:

FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:1.12.0-gpu-py3
> ENV SHELL /bin/bash
> ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive
> RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
> RUN mkdir -p /software && \
>     cd /software && \
>     git clone https://github.com/cerr/CERR.git && \
>     git clone https://github.com/cerr/aimodels.git


You can (after your modifications) test this, push to docker hub, and then
just pull back into Singularity. It's not a direct Singularity recipe, but
hey, it gets the job done.

There shouldn&#39;t be any dialog box that pops up when building the contai=

Hi Marty, I actually tried that first - but in the process a dialogue box c=
omes that requires me to click/select &quot;OK&quot;, but they keyes on my =
keyboard are not mapped to the display it seems and I am not able to procee=
d from here. <br>
<br>
I tried a few other recipes as well from Singularity Hub, haven&#39;t yet b=

 9 and cudnn 7 and has also has git. :(<br>

And as I mentioned previously, if you need to build a custom container for =
your work, have a look at our definition file [1]. We build TensorFlow with=

Not a specific one, but if you search for the label that is the cuda versio=

It looks like you are pointing at a non-existent repository or mirror for t=
he software.=C2=A0 The error reports that the files are not at <br>
the URL you are pointing at.<br>
<br>
I am not a ubuntu person but rather centos but you should be able to point =

I&#39;m not sure - I&#39;d guess it&#39;s the latest in development (1.13.1=
 something) so you could try installing the version you need: <br>

pip install tensorflow=3D=3D1.12.0<br>
