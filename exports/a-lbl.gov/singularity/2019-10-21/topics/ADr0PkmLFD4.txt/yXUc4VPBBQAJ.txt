Mike,

I now realize that I missed the earlier part of this thread, and I
just went back and re-read it from the archives and see that you are
interested in both HPC and cloud workflows.

In my opinion, singularity containers as one large image file is really
only practical when you have a fast shared filesystem like on HPC
systems.  HPC administrators love Singularity compared to storing
software as individual files on their filesystem, because it mounts the
large file as a loopback filesystem, which moves almost all of the
metadata operations to the worker node instead of onto their limited-
resource metadata servers.  In addition, the entire image files are not
downloaded to the worker nodes as a large blob this way; only the pieces
of the container that are actually accessed are downloaded, and only on
demand as they are accessed and not all at the beginning of a job.

By contrast, as you point out, in a cloud you don't have a large fast
filesystem directly mounted on all the nodes.  This is much closer to
the grid model, and this is where CVMFS really shines and what it was
really designed and optimized for.  As I said earlier, CVMFS also moves
all the metadata operations to the worker nodes, and only downloads the
pieces that are actually accessed, and only on demand as they are
accessed.  Fermilab has successfully run a very large workflow of CMS
(the LHC experiment) jobs with this in Amazon's AWS.  Now if we can just
persuade the HPC admins to also support CVMFS, we would have one
mechanism that works well everywhere.  Currently to run on HPC systems
we instead mostly need to set up a large cvmfs client system somewhere
that periodically reads large subsets of what we have installed in CVMFS
and write them out to a big container to copy to each HPC system's
shared filesystem.
