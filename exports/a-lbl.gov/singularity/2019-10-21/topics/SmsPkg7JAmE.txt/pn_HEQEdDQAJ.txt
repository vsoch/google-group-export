I should be more specific, it'll work with the legacy format (ext3) as long 
as you haven't imported an image. Once you do, it will no longer function 
like 2.3.x (you can no longer resize it)

You can either use the sandbox as Dave mentioned previously or for the 
newer image format you can use with *sudo singularity build centos.simg 
docker://centos:latest* but this won't be writable. 
I usually experiment in the sandbox and then create a recipe to build a 
proper immutable image.
