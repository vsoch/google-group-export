Hi Mark,

I think you are pretty closely describing the way the --nv option works in
the latest development version of singularity. If you are able to do so,
why not download and install it in your GPU environment and test it. I'm
sure Greg and the rest of the community would appreciate the testing effort!

Bit late for a reply, but hey :)<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve started looking at using GPUs from within a container and are con=
sidering the issue you describe here.<br>
<br>
I was thinking of cooking up something to work out what files are needed an=
d create zero-length files in the image as placeholders for the GPU librari=
es. Then we can use a horrible set of &#39;--bind&#39; flags to map the rel=
evant files from the host into the image at runtime.<br>
<br>
(I&#39;d rather avoid having a separate gpu-specific copy of singularity wi=
th all the bindings in the configuration file)<br>
<br>
Or, it could work out what files are needed, create symlinks to some empty =
directories out of the way somewhere in the image, then use a small number =
of &#39;--bind&#39; flags to map in the host directories containing those l=
ibraries at runtime. That would be a bit easier for the user to type.<br>
<br>
Or can someone point me at a better solution, please?<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
