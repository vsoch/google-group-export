Also, in case you're curious what I'm doing, I have the same problem as 
this person:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38644259/how-to-install-glibc-2-14-without-admin-right

There does not appear to be a reasonable solution to this otherwise. I 
tried compiling GLIBC 2.17 and placing it elsewhere, and then doing the 
magic incantation to make sure that the regular library files didn't 
interfere with this GLIBC, but then of course some of those libraries in 
/lib64 are required by the program that requires the new GLIBC, which then 
leaves you to build those as well outside of the system tree, and meh, 
forget it. 

The real solution is probably for these folks to not unnecessarily depend 
on a GLIBC that's excessively new.
