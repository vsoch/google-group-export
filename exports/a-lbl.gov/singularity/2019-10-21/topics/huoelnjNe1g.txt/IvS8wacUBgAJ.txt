Do you need network when this is running? You're attempting to do
something that falls outside the security model (i.e. separation of
privileges ... run as root *and* a user).

Does the application *need* network access and does the license server
*need* to run as root? If no to both of those, you can use the network
namespace to create *only* a loop back device in the container. Start
the license server up as the user listening on the loop back device.
Then in the `%environment` section, set something like:

LM_LICENSE_FILE=3D127.0.0.1:[port]

Or whatever it is you use.

*But* running as two different users shouldn't be allowed.

The only way you may be able to hack something like this is starting
an initial process as root, keeping *all* privileges, adding the
non-root user you're wanting to run as to the /etc/passwd file, then
using `su` to ran the program as a different user. I wouldn't
recommend this, as since we didn't drop any privileges, the user
should be able to escalate. Way to brittle, and to much could go wrong
with a root level container running.

Otherwise, your best bet is to have something external that keeps
track of ports in use, for each of the jobs, spin up a special license
server that contact info gets passed along in an environment variable
for the job. Wouldn't prevent the "others can use that license server"
issue, but it would be limiting it down some since it wouldn't be at a
constant location.
