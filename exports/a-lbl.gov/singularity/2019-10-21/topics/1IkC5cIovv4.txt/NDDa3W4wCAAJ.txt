Thats looks good.  If the change is made I expect to also have standard 
directory binds working ?  For example:

singularity exec --containall --bind /dev --bind /home/kmutch --nv 
ubuntu.simg nvidia-smi 
WARNING: Not mounting requested bind point (already mounted in container): 
/dev
WARNING: Not mounting requested bind point (already mounted in container): 
/home/kmutch
NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA 
driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.

Many Thanks for helping with this,
Karl
