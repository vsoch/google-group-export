That's how Singularity Hub (generally) does it, creating an instance with
the API, minus the step to install cuda, and instead using a pre-built
secure build base so the user doesn't need to wait to install Singularity.

Thanks for sharing this - it will be very useful if (for some future) we
could support a GPU builder.
