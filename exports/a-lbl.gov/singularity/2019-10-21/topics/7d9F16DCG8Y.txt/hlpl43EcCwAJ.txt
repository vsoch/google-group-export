Hi Brian,

We were hoping to have something done by now, but other features ended up
taking priority. Now pushing to have something by Q1/Q2 2019 unless there
is some community involvement beforehand.

In terms of an open issue for tracking, check out:
https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/109
