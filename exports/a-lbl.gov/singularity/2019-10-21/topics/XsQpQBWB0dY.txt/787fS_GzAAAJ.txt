Hey Simone,

Apologies for the delay - just getting back from a brief hiatus from my
laptop and still sort of out of it! Could you point me again to the
collection and repo so I can test this manually? What is happening is that
the build seems to be timing out. (The kill happens after too much
inactivity). I don't think it's an issue with your container, likely
something to do with the updated Singularity or builder. Walking through
the steps manually (I should be able to allocate some time over this
weekend) should be a good first start I think.

Best,

Vanessa
