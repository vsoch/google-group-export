Hi Chris,

Here is the debug line that shows the issue:

    Ignored, try to mount 
/uaopt/singularity/2.4.6/var/singularity/mnt/container outside of container 
/gsfs1/uaopt/singularity/2.4.6/var/singularity/mnt/container

The update added checks to ensure that it was not possible to cause 
security issues by mounting outside of the container. In your case it looks 
like '/uaopt' may be a symlink to '/gsfs1/uaopt' - and Singularity was 
configured into a the path with the symlink? In this case, if you install 
with `--prefix=/gsfs1/uaopt.....` things should work as you expect.

If this is not the case please let us know. Also - we'd advise switching to 
Singularity 2.5.1 as soon as you are able, as that contains further 
important security fixes, as well as bug fixes.

Thanks,

DT
