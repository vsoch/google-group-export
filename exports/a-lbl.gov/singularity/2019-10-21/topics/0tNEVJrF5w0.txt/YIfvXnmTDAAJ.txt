Hello Greg,

this is Balazs from RIKEN.
I am playing with v2 and I would like to create a simple container by
packaging up an application with its necessary shared libraries.

I tried InstallFiles in the definition file, but I get the following errors
during bootstrap:
./simple.def: line 8: InstallFiles: command not found
./simple.def: line 9: InstallFiles: command not found

Please note that I would prefer to have only the application in the image
and I don't need any other distribution packages.
I liked the "%files" feature of the v1 spec file and I am wondering, is it
still possible to do that with version 2?

Thanks in advance,
Balazs
