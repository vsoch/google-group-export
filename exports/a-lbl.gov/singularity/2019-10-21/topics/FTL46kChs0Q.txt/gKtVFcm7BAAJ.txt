Hello All,

I'm very new on singularity so sorry if my question is stupid.
I have created an ubuntu image and I would like to install more things on 
this ubuntu image. I would like to do that from the singularity shell, so I 
do:

*singularity shell --writable ubuntu-1604.img*

Then I do* apt-get install vi* but I get an error that I do not have 
permissions. If I try to do *sudo apt-get install vi* it says it doesn't 
exist sudo comand.

I know I could do: *sudo singularity exec --writable ubuntu-1604.img 
apt-get install vi.*. But I thought it was also possible in the shell it 
would be more convenient. I have seen that for a centos image is possible 
to do yum install.

Could you help me on that? Is that normal or I'm missing something?
Thanks a lot,


oriol
