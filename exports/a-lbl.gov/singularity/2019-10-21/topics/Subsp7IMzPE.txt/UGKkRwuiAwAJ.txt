Hiya Ashwin,

Welcome to the Singularity community!

I think your two issues are caused by 2 different things.

1. I think we would need some more details to debug this.  When you are
able to successfully create and remove directories are these in a container
or on the host system?  Are you starting the container with the --writable
flag?  Is it a writable format (like ext3 or a sandbox)?  Does the npm
command need to run as sudo?  If so, you need to enter the container as
sudo, (and the container should also be a writable format and be initiated
with the --writable flag).

You also might want to try building an image that has the base you want and
then issuing you npm command in the %post section of a definition file.  This
guide
<https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.2/user-guide/build_a_container.html#building-containers-from-singularity-definition-files>
might be useful.

2.  This is just a shortcoming of the mac desktop version of Singularity.
Singularity desktop is still very alpha.  Because of permission issues on
mac, networking does not work.  (It's actually denied by the OS.)  For a
better Singularity on mac experience, I suggest you use Vagrant with
one of these
boxes <https://app.vagrantup.com/sylabs>.  You can find info on how to
install on Mac here
<https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.2/user-guide/installation.html#mac>.  If
you have any issues following those instructions, please let me know.

Dave
