Sorry for the noise: I can now happily answer my own question - the way we=
=20
installed singularity 2.1.2 (without prefix) after building in=20
/usr/local/src resulted in a file=20
/usr/local/etc/singularity/singularity.conf which is apparently evaluated=
=20
when /usr/local/bin/singularity is called.

This works:=20
(1) created directory (mount point) /beegfs in the container
(2) added line "bind path =3D /beegfs=E2=80=9D in the singularity.conf that=
 is=20
actually used...

A little benchmarking with iozone showed no discernible performance=20
degradation when running the benchmark from within the container -=20
excellent!

Feature suggestion 1:
This did not work at first for us (and hence the original posting) because=
=20
we did not know which singularity.conf was used. Maybe the documentation=20
could be a bit clearer about that - or, even better, singularity could have=
=20
a commandline option for querying which config files are being used.=20

Feature suggestion 2:
It was also not clear to us whether we needed to provide infiniband or=20
other packages/configurations normally required to mount our parallel file=
=20
(BeeGFS/FhGFS) system inside the container. It turns out - and this is a=20
killer feature of singularity - none of this hassle is needed inside the=20
container for this use case (but it is, obviously, required on the host).=
=20
We could have deduced that from the documentation - but maybe this is=20
something that could feature more prominently in the documentation (not=20
least because it is such a convenient feature).

Best,
 Stefan
