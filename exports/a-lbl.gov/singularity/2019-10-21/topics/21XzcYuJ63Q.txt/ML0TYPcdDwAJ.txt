I think i didnt explain my Needs verry well.

What i want to do is, to create a Parallel Filesystem in some Containers.=
=20
And the Containers should talk via IB like:

Each Service should be a new Container on 1 or more Physical Machines.

Container:Management
Container: Metadata1 - ...
Container: Storage1 -...
Physical: Client1 - ...

And now they should communicate via IB to get the most throughput and low=
=20
Latency.

But in dont know if this is the Kind Singularity should be used. I think=20
Singularity Containers should be used to containerize HPC Apps and then run=
=20
on a Cient that is sending Traffic via IB to a Physically Parallel File=20
System. But i Am not sure About it.

I Hope you understand me.

Greetings Tobi
