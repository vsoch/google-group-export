Wow, I didn't realize this would generate so much discussion.  I probably 
should not have posted such a flippant response, sorry. I have read all of 
the replies and basically Tru has it right.  Yes, sudo provides more 
fine-grained permissions than just giving someone root but whoever is 
granting sudo privileges needs to understand what the particular command 
does.  In this case, sudo singularity lets you, among other things, 
bind-mount any file system into the container and then gives you a shell 
with uid 0 in the container.  If the filesystem is a shared NFS mount that 
is not set up to squash root then you will have the ability to do "root 
stuff" in that file system from inside the container.

This brings me to what I see as the biggest challenge in our environment 
(HPC facility).  If we want to let users run singularity containers on our 
systems, they need a place where they are root so they can build the 
container.  And we don't give users root on our systems for a myriad of 
reasons, one being shared filesystems.  So they need to find some place 
else to build their container.  Some of them have access to a Linux desktop 
where they have root, others have to get more creative.  And if they build 
it somewhere else, they won't have access to their home directory, which 
probably contains stuff they need to build their application.

The other part of this problem is if you want a container to be portable, 
meaning a  container that you can to give to other people to run, you can't 
make any assumptions about their home directory path.  So you need to make 
sure that any applications you build in your container are ultimately not 
dependent on anything in your home dir.  In our environment, the mount 
point we use for home dirs (/g) does not exist in the container so the bind 
mount fails.  I could certainly create that mount point in my container, 
but if I give it to someone else with a different home directory path, all 
bets are off as to whether their home dir will mount or not.
