I'm all for extra checks -- and I found bugs by adding them -- if the
engineering trades-off are worth it, but I don't see how it helps here,
especially in comparison with putting effort into checking the setuid
program.

That's not happening here anyway.  (I avoided declarations in the docker
import support because they weren't used elsewhere.)  How does it help
to replace

  ...
  ... "$x" ...

with

  set -u
  ...
  ... "${x:-}" ...
?

Fair enough, but I've never been convinced by anything other than care
and understanding when it comes to shell scripts.
