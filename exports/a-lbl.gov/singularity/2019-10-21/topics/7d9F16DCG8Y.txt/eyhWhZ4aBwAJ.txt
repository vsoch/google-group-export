Hi there =E2=80=93 just saw this discussion and I have an interest in this =
too as I=20
have an application in mind for Singularity which would become far more=20
interesting for a lot of macOS based users if it were possible to use the=
=20
system provided hypervisor framework instead of Vagrant. I'm by no means a=
=20
virtualisation expert but I am a Mac developer for a decade now and know=20
the platform well. So, I'm not sure how much help I would be but I'd be=20
happy to try and help if you can give me some pointers of the Singularity=
=20
specifics that would be needed to be macOS Hypervisor.framework integrated.
