Hi Dave,

I have similar issue but after installing the squashfs-tools fixed that 
issue.

But now when I try to run a container I get the following error.

singularity run d.img
ERROR  : Failed to mount squashfs image in (read only): No such device
ABORT  : Retval = 255

This is the error when I run in debug mode

VERBOSE [U=0,P=34698]      singularity_image_squashfs_mount()        
Mounting squashfs image: /dev/loop0 -> 
/usr/local/var/singularity/mnt/container
ERROR   [U=0,P=34698]      singularity_image_squashfs_mount()        Failed 
to mount squashfs image in (read only): No such device
ABORT   [U=0,P=34698]      singularity_image_squashfs_mount()        Retval 
= 255

I was not able to understand what this error is?

It would be really helpful If any one can through some light on this.

Thanks,
Varun
