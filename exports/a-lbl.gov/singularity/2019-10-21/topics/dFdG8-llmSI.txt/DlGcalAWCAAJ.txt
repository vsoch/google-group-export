Hi All,

I am trying to build a container from the existing Linux host using this 
recipe (just to try if it works):
============
Bootstrap: self 
Exclude: /var/lib/docker /tmp/* /home/* /opt/*
============
First of all: why does it put binaries to stdout/stderr? I would not expect 
to see there anything but directories/files to be included into the image 
and at the beginning that was what was shown but now my terminal is going 
crazy because of all those binaries printed to the screen.
Second: is "Exclude" syntax correct? I got an impression that it does not 
really work.

Is this feature in principle supported?

Thank you,
Igor
