I will look into this in more detail. There are some technical difficulties
that Singularity would have rather then Docker, LXC and OpenVZ namely
because they all run daemons as root, so it is the root process which
invokes the checkpointing. Singularity doesn't use a root owned daemon and
thus the calls to ptrace() from CRIU would not work.

As I said, I will investigate this before the release of 2.3, but please
submit a feature enhancement request via the Github issue tracker (just to
be sure I don't forget).

Thanks!
