Subject: Re: [Singularity] Submit additional jobs from within a container
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Wouldn't you need to configure the container a slurm/torque what have
you client?  If, internal to the container, it can run the slurm
client commands, and it knows the correct scheduler node name,
wouldn't that work?  That seems like it would be required to stick
with the purpose of containing the application to the environment
inside the container.  What am I missing?
