Singularity sets up the environment and then exec's itself out of
existence, passing the PID and flushing itself from memory when the program
within the container is running. You are finding that there is no
Singularity process running on your system when a Singularity container is
in fact running. This is correct because Singularity attaches the kernel
namespaces to the actively running process(es). When that process
completes, those namespaces collapse and the kernel cleans up, flushing the
namespaces completely and leaving a clean system.

It really is quite elegant if I do say so myself. ;)

As far as memory consumption, it could be a few things, but it is not
Singularity as Singularity is no longer taking up resident memory.

And for Slurm, check into using the CGroups support.

Hope that helps!

Greg
