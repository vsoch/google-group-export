Ok i'm still reading all the docs to understand these tools..

-Now, is Tunel the same as Singularity Python? Just one has a GUI and the 
other command interface? 
-I read that Singularity Python can convert from a format to another. does 
it generate Singularity recipes from scratch? (I want to have a recipe 
generator that can take user input and standardize recipes across all our 
containers)
- does  Experiment factory support Singularity? I see everything about 
Docker. Can i use it to generate Singularity recipes and Singularity 
containers ...?


Thank you,
