Hi Edward,

We *very strongly* recommend using an up-to-date version of Singularity. Be=
fore committing to running 2.4.6 for the foreseeable future please ensure y=
ou review the release notes for 2.5.0 and newer at:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases

These highlight reasons why we recommend running a newer version. The reaso=
n to require PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS has also been discussed at length here:

https://www.sylabs.io/2018/05/whatsnew-singularity-2-5-why-affects-everyone=
-using-containers/

Cheers,

DT
