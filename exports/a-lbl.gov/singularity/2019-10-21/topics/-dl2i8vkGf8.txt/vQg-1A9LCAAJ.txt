I haven't played with runC, but your mail has stirred my curiosity.

- I am still running CentOS-5, and runC needs golang which does not
  support my current soon EOL distribution of choice.
  I failed to compile the latest go 1.6.2 from go 1.4.2/1.4.3:
<snip>
[tru@sillage src]$  GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./bootstrap.bash
#### Copying to ../../go-linux-amd64-bootstrap

#### Cleaning ../../go-linux-amd64-bootstrap

#### Building ../../go-linux-amd64-bootstrap

##### Building Go bootstrap tool.
cmd/dist
FATAL: kernel too old
go build _/home/tru/build/go-linux-amd64-bootstrap/src/cmd/dist: /c5/shared/go/amd64/1.4.2/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/6g: signal: segmentation fault
</snip> 

That pretty much a road block for me: I can't even compile the compiler to build the tool!
Of course that not an issue if your are running a recent linux distribution, but what
will happen in a few years when golang and runC move forward?

OTOH, I just need a basic environment and I can build singularity on all my
platforms, (CentOS-5 CentOS-6 and now CentOS-7) the idea is being able to use
singularity to allow the newer distribution to run the older binaries without
too much effort.
RHEL is providing N->N+1 runtime "assurance" between major releases,
singularity might give me N->N+2 or more without too much effort (ie by
packaging and not recompiling).


With singularity I gain a backward compatibility for free: a CentOS-6 (glibc
2.12) getconf running on CentOS-5 is neat:
[tru@sillage singularity]$ rpm -q glibc
glibc-2.5-123.el5_11.3.i686
glibc-2.5-123.el5_11.3.x86_64
[tru@sillage singularity]$ singularity exec Centos-6.img getconf  GNU_LIBC_VERSION
glibc 2.12

Of course there are limitation, a CentOS-7 container does not run on my CentOS-5:
[tru@sillage singularity]$ singularity exec Centos-7.img df
FATAL: kernel too old

Fair enough, retro compatibility has limits!

Likewise, I hope to be able to package executable accross linux distributions:
debian/ubuntu/alpine. Portability and simplicity are strong selling points.

I still build from sources, rpm build for a specific distribution, using
modules (or lmod) to isolate the dependencies and software versions (or use
easybuild/spark/SCL/... your choice of framework). Singularity would allow
me to give these prebuilt tools to others distributions of the same family 
or not.

Bottom line, I believe that singularity is adressing my needs, ymmv :D

Best regards,

Tru
