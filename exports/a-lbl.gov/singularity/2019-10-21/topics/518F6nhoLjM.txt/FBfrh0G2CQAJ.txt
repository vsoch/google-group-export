Hi Lars,

Here's my take on this.

If you really want to override the tests and build Singularity on a system
that does not implement the NO_NEW_PRIVS features you can always modify the
code.  It shouldn't be too hard to figure out where the tests are occurring
and what steps must be taken to disable them.  I think this is better than
providing a built-in override option.  Running Singularity in any way shape
or form on systems without NO_NEW_PRIVS is not supported.  Nobody is going
to be testing older versions of the kernel for undiscovered vulnerabilities
that might still affect Singularity.  If an admin just absolutely cannot be
bothered to upgrade their head/build node to support this feature than they
must do what they feel is right.  But by modifying the source code they are
stating that they know what they are doing and they are happy to be on
their own.

Dave
