Hey Luca,

Ah yes, I know docker2singularity well because I wrote most of the runtime
script,
<https://github.com/vsoch/singularity-tools/blob/master/docker/docker2singu=
larity.sh>
that
somehow was scraped of any credit via improper use of version control, lol.
When you export the docker environment using that script,it writes directly
to a file /environment, which mirrors how the very first singularity images
were set up. Later images (made with singularity proper) store the docker
environment variables in the image's metadata "env" folder, available via
shell or exec with a simple source:

for script in /.singularity.d/env/*.sh; do
>     if [ -f "$script" ]; thenHere is where
>         . "$script"
>     fi
> done


so you don't have the environment variables because they aren't being
sourced. The option with -e would clean the environment from your host, not
what is in the container. Here is where
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/master/src/lib/runtime=
/environment/environment.c#L57>
some of this happens, if it helps.

I think if you want this to work as expected, you should put your docker
image on docker hub, and then bootstrap appropriately:

singularity create image.img
> sudo singularity bootstrap image.img Singularity


This will handle the Docker environment to coincide with the current
implementation that sources it. Give that a go and see if it helps.

Best,

Vanessa
