Hello,

Is it possible to limit/control network access of a singularity container? 
The use case I'm interested in is to only allow network access from inside 
a singularity container to a specific whitelist of network CIDRs.
The containers will be running on an HPC system to which we don't have root 
access to control the firewall, and we want to limit what software running 
in a container can access over the network.

Such a use case would allow running "un-trusted" code in a container with 
guarantees that they can only connect to certain hosts/ports.

Thank you,
Boris
