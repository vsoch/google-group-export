Subject: Community Feedback: Sylabs Builder API as Singularity Registry Endpoint
To: singularity@lbl.gov

Hey Everyone!

I'm interested in feedback about if the community would be interested in
having the Sylabs "Builder" API as a backend plugin for Singularity
Registry Server. I don't have an API key yet to test and develop this, but
assuming this is do-able I'm interested to know:

 - how should the builds be triggered?
 - how do we ensure they are reproducible (e.g., recipes could be still
added via connection of Github repos, and use these similar Github
triggers, or something else?)

This would not solve the issue of scaling the server to again receive the
finished images - I will need to test the API to understand how it's
working to give suggestions that might be possible. Ideally the Sylabs API
would give choice to have different cloud storage endpoints that
Singularity Registry could then keep a record of (this is what Singularity
Hub does with Google Cloud --> Google Cloud Storage).

Remember, it's important to build reproducibility into this set up. While
it's nice to trigger a build and then have it appear, if you don't maintain
the recipe or similar or a record of the command you make it harder for a
future user of your container to understand the context of its generation,
or rebuild if needed.

Please comment here, or if you preference is Github (I'll better find it
there in the future!) on the issue board here
<https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues/153>. As a reminder
Singularity Registry server currently can handle push and pull operations
along with management of teams, but does not build the images for you. This
plugin would allow you to put in (I'm guessing some API token) to trigger
builds from the server to Sylabs and back!

Thanks!

Best,

Vanessa
