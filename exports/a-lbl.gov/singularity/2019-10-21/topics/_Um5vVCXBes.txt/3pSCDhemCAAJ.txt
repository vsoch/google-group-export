Hi Peter,

 I struggled with this as well.
I made it work without further modifications on my Linux Mint 17.1 laptop 
which apparently has namespaces enabled.

Centos 7.2 is however a much older environment. 
Its user namespace support is still experimental and when I enable it (you 
can force it to enabled by passing a kernel param) it fails due to a 
non-working mount namespace.
Really no idea when this will officially work on RHEL/CentOS but would be 
definitely appreciated.

greets Stefan
