Hi there,

 I am trying to access my private repo on DockerHub according to 
https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/blob/docs/2.3/pages/docs/user-docs/docs-docker.md
and it works manually as described in that document. And I verified I get 
an valid token and the list of images.
However, when I run I get:

ubuntu@containerserverdev:~$ singularity -vvv import myapp.img 
docker://c1t4r/usecases:JUSTUS_base
Increasing verbosity level (4)
Singularity version: 2.2.99-development.g945c6ee
