Thanks for the suggestion - but has SquashFS any advantages over ZFS for 
Singularity in my application apart from being less complex (which is an 
advantage, of course)? ZFS also has online compression in addition to the 
validation features we are keen on. - And maybe this is a stupid question, 
but "how much operating system" do I need/should I have if I am primarily 
interested in accessing the files within the container (ideally by mounting 
a file system)?

Best regards,
 Stefan
