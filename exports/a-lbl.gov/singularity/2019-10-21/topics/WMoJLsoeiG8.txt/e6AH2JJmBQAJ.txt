I am going to ask Brian Bockelman to step in here, as he is our resident

Gotcha, that makes perfect sense.

Understood. Cedric's patch will be included as soon as possible, but not
part of the 2.4.1 release which will be announced as alpha just in time for
Supercomputing.

Assuming you are referring to using the kernel user namespace, I have no
tried it and Michael Bauer has been the primary devel on that project. I
don't see why it would not, but I must defer to Michael.

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0My hope is the HTCondor people will at some point r=
ework interactive jobs so the sshd can run outside the container and just u=
se unprivileged nsenter to enter the container.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You could do that but `nsenter` or rather the system call `setns()` im=
plies a running container instance. With Singularity, you don&#39;t need th=
at, and you can just use the Singularity shell idea I mentioned earlier, or=
 the (very simple and clean) solution that Jeff mentioned. But... If you wa=
nt to instead join an existing set of namespaces, Singularity supports that=
 with instances, however I&#39;m not sure a running instance is required.<b=
r>
</span>I can&#39;t use the Singularity shell idea for our setup without doi=
ng one of two things:<br>
- Grant the users SSH access to our worker nodes. I don&#39;t want to do th=
at - they are in a private network behind a NAT gateway. The only access us=
ers get is via the reverse connections initiated by HTCondor.<br>
=C2=A0 This also ensures HTCondor is completely aware of anything user-rela=
ted running on those machines.<br>
- Rewriting the logic of HTCondor. Currently, it always (no matter whether =
bare metal or container) fires up a dummy job in case an interactive job is=
 requested (it just runs a &quot;sleep 180&quot; job).<br>
=C2=A0 Then, the &quot;ssh-to-job&quot; approach is used, as if one would a=
ttach to a &quot;real&quot; running job. The idea is to enter the exact sam=
e environment of the job.<br>
<br>
For this, of course either nsenter or instances would be fully working idea=
s. I suggested both on the HTCondor list a while ago, sadly there&#39;s sti=
ll no reply...<br>
<br>
But of course, I see many other applications in other environments for the =
Singularity shell, so I greet the idea ;-).<br></blockquote><div><br></div>=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Then, we could also use that with user namespaces. =

<span class=3D"">&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We can use the user namespace, without SetUID, now for this (if you ar=
e not using file based images). But you are right, Cedric&#39;s PR there is=
 highly advantageous.<br>
</span>With nsenter, there&#39;s a huge problem without Cedric&#39;s PR in:=
 When using nsenter to attach the container, you end up in the same mount n=
amespace, but with / being the root of the host.<br>
With Cedric&#39;s PR, this is resolved (due to the use of pivot_root).<br>
That&#39;s why I would say that at least the &quot;nsenter&quot; approach r=
equires this PR to be in to be useful.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If you&#39;re not into setting up a workload manage=

&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes, ch-ssh may offer a similar functionally to what I was describing =

&gt;<br>
&gt; Great ideas!<br>

Maybe another question, just since I did not test it yet - do Singularity&#=
