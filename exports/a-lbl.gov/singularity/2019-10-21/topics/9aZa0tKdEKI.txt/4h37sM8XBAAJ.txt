Hi Jason

We do not include /cm/shared in singularity.conf (this is a Centos 6 system 
so we have to specify the bind directories).  So I will add 
libcudart.so.7.5 (and I guess the newer ones for anyone using a newer cuda) 
into nvliblist.conf.  She uses --nv so that should be compatible.  I will 
give it a whirl

Thanks
Chris

<br>&gt; Hi
<br>&gt; I&#39;m trying to help my user who is getting this message:

o.7.5:
<br>&gt; cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory...

 I could
