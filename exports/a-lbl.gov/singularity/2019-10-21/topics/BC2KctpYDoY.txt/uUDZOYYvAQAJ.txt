Thank you for your responses! I am also using modules already to set the 
environments for other software and I will use it to let the users switch 
between Singularity versions. Apparently, Singularity RPM packages put 
files in different (and more distributed) folders than building directly 
from source. I did that first actually, with Singularity 2.2.1, which 
matches the experience that you had, Jared. Unfortunately, when doing this 
for Singularity version 2.4, something was changed, and the build process 
still put a few files in other locations outside of my PREFIX based 
directory, e.g. it installs a /usr/bin/singularity executable script that 
calls then to something in the installed folder, but nothing that is 
directly executable anymore.  That's the reason why I was hoping that via 
RPM packages I would have more luck.
