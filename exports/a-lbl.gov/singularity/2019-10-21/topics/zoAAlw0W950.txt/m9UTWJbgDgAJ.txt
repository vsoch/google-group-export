Thanks for the quick reply. From reading that link, it seems that the 
functionality lost would be 

1) the ability to create custom run/start scripts (not immediately clear 
what the difference is between run and start scripts, but I can check the 
documentation for further clarity)

2) Sourcing some default environment scripts

3) For the "libs" feature, couldn't I make these host system libs available 
w/in the container manually by using a bind flag?

The most concerning is the "action" commands. We definitely want the 
ability to call singularity exec <command> /image/to/vnfs/image. So far 
this seems to be working for us, but it's not clear if there will be any 
side effects. 

It seems like these scripts wouldn't be too hard to replicate, though, from 
what you write. I could create them manually, I suppose. One thing we've 
thought about doing was adding to Singularity a "singularity from vnfs" 
feature that would properly invoke the metadata creation functionality.
