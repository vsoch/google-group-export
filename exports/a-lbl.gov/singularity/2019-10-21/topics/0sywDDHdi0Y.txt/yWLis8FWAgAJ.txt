I am still considering how best to do some level of internal dependency
checking during bootstrap. I can bring back some of the LDD dependency
walking code and other InstallFile checks into v2, but still if this
happens outside of a bootstrap I won't be able to catch it.

I would recommend that we create some FAQs and example bootstrap
definitions for IMPI support over IB.
