I don't have access to the singularity slack.  Can you have someone give me an account?  I totally wouldn't mind talking about this stuff. 

Since I discovered singularity, it has completely changed my workflow (in a good way), so I really want to see this project be successful. As far as portibility goes, I can totally understand the sentiment there.  I thought about just digging into the source code and quietly adding it to our environment myself, but I think it would be more valuable if everyone could access that functionality (and I don't have to maintain a fork).  Maybe a good middle ground would be to provide the functionality, but disable it by default in the global config. Then that way you retain the portability aspect by default, but if you are someone like me that is working in a proprietary environment and doesn't care much about portability or purity, it can be turned on.
