Hi Thomas:

I would not be able to use --bind, since my host is Fedora 28, while the 
guest is CentOS 6, and it would mess up the host if I tried to yum install 
anything in the guest.

I did try the --writable option, but that gives me a message: WARNING: no 
overlay partition found

I tried the --writable-tmpfs and this works.  It will allow me to write to 
/var.  But, the way the /var filesystem shows up in df, it looks like there 
is 0% space available on it:

> df -kh .
df: Warning: cannot read table of mounted file system: No such file or 
directory
Filesystem          Size     Used     Avail    Use Mounted on
-                             0           0           0       -   /

And, a "yum install" or "yum update" will fail, since it believe the 
filesystem is out of space so it can't download the files

thanks,
Paul

<br>
<br>have you tried to bind /var/abc explicitly in the container?
<br>I.e.,
<br>=C2=A0 --bind /var/abc
<br>
<br>But mounting your host&#39;s /var might be not really desirable as you =

<br>Probably a sandbox-container or --writable would be safer.
