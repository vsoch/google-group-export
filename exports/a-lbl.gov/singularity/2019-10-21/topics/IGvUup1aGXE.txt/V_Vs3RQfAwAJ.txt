Subject: Re: [Singularity] Can a singularity container execute programs
 "outside" of the container?

I think likely you would do good to decouple the job scheduler for the
thing actually being run. For example. if someone (with a different
submission need / scheduler) wanted to use your software, it would be
embedded with your scheduler. On the other hand, if the container is just
an executable that can be run by a general scheduler (yours included) this
goes much farther.

I'm not sure about the specifics for your software, but this is the
approach that I would take. Trying tricks to get the scheduler (or a
wrapper around it) working in the container doesn't seem like it would work
nicely if moved to a different environment.
