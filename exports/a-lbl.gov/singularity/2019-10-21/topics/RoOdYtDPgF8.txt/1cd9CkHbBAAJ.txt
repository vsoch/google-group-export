Oh, I hadn't tried it with docker in the way yet.  I tried a
fuse-premount with docker run just now, with the command to run being a
shell script that just prints the parameter and runs bash so I can do
what I want with it and the last parameter a writable mount point as
fuse-premount expects:
    ./fuse-premount docker run --rm -it fedora:latest /tmp/bashit $HOME/tmp=
/mnt
and I got an error from docker:
    docker: Error response from daemon: oci runtime error: container_linux.=
go:247: starting container process caused "process_linux.go:359: container =
init caused \"rootfs_linux.go:43: preparing rootfs caused \\\"Error found l=
ess than 3 fields post '-' in \\\\\\\"825 824 0:110 / /cloud/login/dwd/tmp/=
mnt rw,relatime - fuse  rw,user_id=3D3382,group_id=3D9996\\\\\\\"\\\"\"".
    ERRO[0000] error getting events from daemon: context canceled

I got around that by changing the first parameter sent to the mount command
in fuse-premount.c to "fuse", and added "-v /tmp/bashit:/tmp/bashit" to
map the script inside the container. =20

I then found that the file descriptor created by fuse-premount was not
passed in to the docker container.  I'm quite sure that's because docker
containers aren't created as children of the docker process, they are
children of the docker-containerd daemon.  So that's probably never
going to work unless there's some option to pass selected file
descriptors through (like fuserpremount does) but I don't see such an
existing option.

I haven't been able to get fuse-premount to work with singularity yet
either, because somewhere during initialization singularity tries to do
an fstat on the open file descriptor, and it hangs because there's
nothing yet implementing the fuse filesystem. It's not obvious where
this is happening.  I think we'll just need to wait for the singularity
--fusecmd option, or maybe it would work in some other daemonless
container system like podman.

Oh, if you're willing to user linux kernel 4.18+ then you don't even
need libfuse3.

Just run "unshare -Ufirmp".  That gets you a fake root unprivileged user
namespace.  Then just run sshfs giving it a mount point of some empty
directory that you have write access to.  I haven't tried it in
unprivileged docker yet, but it should work.
