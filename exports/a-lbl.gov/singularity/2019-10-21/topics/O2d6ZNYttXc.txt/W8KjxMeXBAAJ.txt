 arbitrary user
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process running outside the container.
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can imagine there are undiscovered race conditi=
ons when the
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; filesystem image is modified while it is mounted.
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if there&#39;s a new feature needed which =
allows one to `pull` an
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; image but not allow it to be modified by the unpriv=
ileged user?=C2=A0 It&#39;d
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a nice compromise between the default mode and l=
imiting users to
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only using image directories.

<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; *Scanner*
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; David has been working on a Clair (securit=
y scanner) to go alongside
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Singularity Registry.
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure about the status, but it =
would be great to get this working
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for some kind of optional plugin.
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think scanning containers with Cla=
ir really addresses the issue
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thread of exploiting filesystem drivers - it&#=
39;s just checking for CVEs
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; present in
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any apt/yum packages installed inside the cont=
ainer. I think it&#39;s a
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful thing
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though.
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current status of this work is:
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0* There&#39;s a working python CLI tool =
that will scan a Singularity image
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using Clair
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0and spit out basic JSON/text info=
rmation about identified issues:
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

rud/clair-singularity" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://github.co=
m/dctrud/cla<wbr>ir-singularity</a>
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0It requires Clair to be spun-up u=
nder docker to do this (instructions
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0README using some handy pre-popul=
ated docker hub images).
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0* I&#39;m currently thinking about integ=
ration with how we plan to use
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sregistry
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0here at UTSW. We definitely want =
something like the <a href=3D"http://quay.io" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_b=
lank">quay.io</a> security
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reports
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0visible in our internal registry =
web interface. I know Vanessa is
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keen to
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0keep sregistry as unencumbered as=
 possible with extra stuff, so I&#39;m
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0about the idea of a plugin-able D=
jango app, and being able to setup
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; periodic
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0/ on upload scanning through hand=
led by celery jobs with that. It&#39;s
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0definitely something we want to h=
ave here, so will happen - just not
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0entirely sure when, as I&#39;m co=
mmitted to a lot of training and things
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0next couple of months.
