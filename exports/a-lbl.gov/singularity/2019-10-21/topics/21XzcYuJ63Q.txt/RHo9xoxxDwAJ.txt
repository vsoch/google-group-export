This really depends on the parallel file system you are trying to deploy. =
=20
Lustre Servers run completely inside the linux kernel, so there is little=
=20
reason to containerize them.  Some of the other filesystems run in=20
userspace and could containerize effectively, such as ceph, pvfs2, etc. =20
you would need to look at how they serve files, and if they require linux=
=20
kernel modules to do the work.

What filesystem were you looking at?
