Hi there,

 if I wanted to provide functionally identical containers in common formats 
such as Docker, Singularity, Shifter and OCI - what intermediate format 
would I choose?
It all boils down to the question? What file system level information is 
lost if I say take the contents of a docker image, create a tar.gz and 
combine that with an extended ACL file, and convert it into an arbitrary 
container format?
What is needed to consider to yield an appropriate base for building 
containers in any of these formats?

thanks in advance for your suggestions
Stefan
