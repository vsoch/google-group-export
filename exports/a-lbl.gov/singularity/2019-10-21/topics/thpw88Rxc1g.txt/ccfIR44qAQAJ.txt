 What I am most interested in is preventing files in the host system&#39;s =
user home directory from affecting the environment of the container shell.=

our cluster, so he ended up shipping his data off site for years.=C2=A0 Whe=

 his home directory that was enabling profiling in his code.=C2=A0 He had t=
otally forgotten about the config file.=C2=A0 But this is the sort of probl=
em that singularity could prevent by providing a consistent, self-contained=

from outside the container introduces the possibility of all kinds of site-=
specific differences into the container.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m t=
