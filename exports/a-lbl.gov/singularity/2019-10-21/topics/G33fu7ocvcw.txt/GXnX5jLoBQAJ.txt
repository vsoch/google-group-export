Thanks for the review and statement.

FYI, here is a useful related post by one of the maintainers of LXC, which
determined they were affected by a related issue and produced a patch:

https://brauner.github.io/2019/02/12/privileged-containers.html
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fbrauner=

rfAYn0d8U%2B5TJaohZ8k%3D&reserved=3D0>

The post contains a useful discussion of the role of privileged versus
unprivileged containers that is similar in spirit to the one provided by
the Singularity team, but in my humble opinion goes further.

Thanks again for the study and response.

Alan
