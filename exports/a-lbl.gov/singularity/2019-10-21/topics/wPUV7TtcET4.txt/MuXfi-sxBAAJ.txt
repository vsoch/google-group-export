Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity and "development mode" python package
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hello Vanessa,

Thanks for your answer. The problem is that the executable of the
"development version" of itzi is actually in /usr/local/bin/itzi.
This executable is a Python script that call the python files inside
the user HOME directory.

cat /usr/local/bin/itzi

#!/usr/bin/python
# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'itzi','console_scripts','itzi'
__requires__ =3D 'itzi'
import sys
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

if __name__ =3D=3D '__main__':
    sys.exit(
        load_entry_point('itzi', 'console_scripts', 'itzi')()


So it seems that the trouble happen because pkg_resources says where
are the actual files to be executed.
Unfortunately I haven't found information on how to circumvent this.
My guess is that is defined by some kind of Python environment.

Regards,
Laurent
