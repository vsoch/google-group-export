I think trying to reduce the container size is always a good idea.

Said that, IMO small containers are needed much more when working with
Docker, because images need to be downloaded from the hub and stored
locally in each node. So you would waste not just storage but also
bandwidth.

Since the Singularity image is shared between all nodes, I would not worry
about the size image and go for a fat container.


Cheers,
Paolo
