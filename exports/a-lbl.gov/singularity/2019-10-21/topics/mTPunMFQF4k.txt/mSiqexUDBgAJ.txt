Hi,

I think that behaviour occurs if you installed a previous version and you
did not remove everything deeply, before trying that new install.

So perhaps you could try to remove every singularity folders/files, then
logout/login and reinstall it.

My singularity software is installed in a NFS directory, and I use module
to load it. It works perfectly.

However, something like ~/.local/singularity.conf could be interesting to
manage different user's configurations.

Best regards,

R=C3=A9my
