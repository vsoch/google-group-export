Howdy Singularity Containerds!  

Here's a release candidate for v3.2.1

https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.2.1-rc1

This point release fixes a few pesky bugs that were discovered in v3.2.0.  
In particular it:

- Allows users to join instances with non-suid workflow
- Removes false warning when seccomp is disabled on the host
- Fixes an issue in the terminal when piping output to commands
- Binds NVIDIA persistenced socket when `--nv` is invoked

If you want to get involved, testing is a great way to help out!  Install 
this release candidate, take it for a spin and try to break it.  The more 
bugs are discovered while the release is still a candidate the fewer bugs 
will make it to general availability!  This candidate will probably be made 
into a generally available (GA) release on Tuesday (after the US holiday). 

As always, please report any bugs to:
https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/new

And if you think that you've discovered a security vulnerability please 
report it to:
secu...@sylabs.io

Your friends at Sylabs
