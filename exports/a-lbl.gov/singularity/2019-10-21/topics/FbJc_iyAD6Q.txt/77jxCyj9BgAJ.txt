Thanks Stefan, the recipe was very useful for what I needed to do and 
probably saved me days of trying to learn Wine and experimenting with 
Singularity container recipe.

Wine seems to have gone a long way since the years I messed with it last, 
the few Windows programs I tried worked flawlessly.

I created a container to run an IDL application using IDL runtime under 
Windows. Our original hope was to use the Linux version of IDL runtime, 
but, there is a bug in IDL that caused it to segfault when running this 
application. IDL support was helpful but essentially said to reprogram the 
application to use different widget style (a particular widget type was 
causing the crash), which was something I was not keen on spending time on 
(no real interest to learn IDL).

So, few weeks later, your Wine recipe came, and after some massaging I got 
this to run under Ubuntu/Wine on our CentOS cluster. The recipe is here in 
case someone's interested:
https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/Singularity-ubuntu-wine-peakselector
It is still localized because of the particular application, but, may be a 
good demonstration of a research code using your approach.

I am hopeful we'll use this instead of doing specialized Windows VM in the 
future.

Thanks to everyone for all your work on all of this.

MC
