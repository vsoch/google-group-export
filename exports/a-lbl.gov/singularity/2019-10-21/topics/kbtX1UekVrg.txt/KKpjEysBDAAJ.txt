As I said in a PM to Afif, there is the small outside chance that we could
run into a situation similar to the 2.x to 3.x transition totally within
the 3.x series.  Let's say we have released 3.1.0 and a security exploit is
discovered for 3.0.0.  If enough code has changed between 3.1.0 and 3.0.0
then the exploit may not affect 3.1.0.  If that's the case, there is no
explicit guarantee that a patch would be developed and published for
3.0.0.

Although in practice, the older version probably would be patched (and
indeed we did just release a patch the 2.6 series even though it is
technically not supported) there is no _explicit guarantee_ that an older
version will be supported.

I think that is the reason that Afif and the gang have decided to drop
Singularity from Stable.  Right Afif?
