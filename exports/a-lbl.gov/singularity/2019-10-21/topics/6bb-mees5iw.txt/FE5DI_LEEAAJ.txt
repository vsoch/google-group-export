Hi Ivan,

Singularity doesn't yet have orchestration, and there is no "best practices=
" defined for this so I can walk you through the options. I am doing an ana=
lysis that implements a bunch of tools across genomics, and I found it easi=
est to install them into one container and then call the container as an ex=
ecutable for different functions (and if you need help with issuing command=
s with exec we can talk about this too). Your other option of course is to =
go with modularity, and create different contains for different software su=
ites, which might make sense if you are using already modular docker contai=
ners. For orchestration I would suggest plugging the container as an execut=
able into your workflow software of choice. I know that nextflow has alread=
y been used various times and there are examples to start with!

We have users and developers for nextflow also on our slack, so I would sug=
gest jumping on and chatting with everyone to work through specific questio=
ns. I am currently traveling but can help via this list or slack if you wan=
t to discuss details.

Best,

Vanessa
