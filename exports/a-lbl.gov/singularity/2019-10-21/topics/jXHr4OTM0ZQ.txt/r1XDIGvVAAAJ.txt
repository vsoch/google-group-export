I think what Chihsong is alluding to is the fact that sudo can be
configured to give users fine grained permissions.  Strictly speaking, sudo
!= root (or sudo <= root).  It is possible as a sys admin (and not
necessarily a bad strategy) to add users to the sudoers group, but to
restrict what they can actually do with sudo.

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/limiting-root-access-with-sudo-part-1/

Apparently, that is what Chihsong's sys admin has done.  But it sounds like
singularity is not respecting those fine grained permissions.  It sees sudo
and thinks "root" so once Chihsong is in a container they experience a de
facto privilege escalation.  Is this correct?  Maybe because the container
has an /etc/sudoers file that differs from the host?  If so, my $0.02 is
that it's a bug in Singularity.  But I don't really see how to fix it...
