Hey all,
I'm new to Singularity and am still testing the waters, so forgive my 
ignorance.  

We distribute our source code via git using SSH, and I'm trying to 
eliminate the user prompt to add the git repo's SSH key to known_hosts 
(i.e. "The authenticity of host HOSTNAME (IP_ADDRESS) can't be 
established...") that occurs the first time I do a git clone during a fresh 
container build.  I'd like to add our git server's known_host entry (which 
doesn't change) manually within the Singularity recipe before cloning the 
git repo.

This warning only occurs for fresh container builds, i.e. if I change my 
Singularity recipe to delete the local copy of the git repo and reclone it, 
then rebuild the same container using the modified recipe, the warning 
doesn't pop up, but if I delete the container and create a new one, the 
prompt appears again.  It appears that ~/.ssh/known_host maps to the file 
on the host, which clearly isn't changing, otherwise I wouldn't have to 
re-add the SSH key with every new container.  So clearly the known_host 
entry is being stored somewhere in the container.  But where?

If it helps, I'm using the ubuntu:latest bootstrap, which is pulling 
openssh-client (1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4).
- Will
