Heya Dave,

Sorry for the delay.  We made an edit to the security page.  After the
numbered list identifying the security procedure we've added a note to
clarify that all patches will be made public.  Does that make sense?

I was going to ask that someone update the security policy with this<br>

&gt; &gt; in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stable.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think it necessarily needs to be that strong, based o=
n the Q&amp;A<br>
&gt; &gt; you link below (more details on that point below).=C2=A0 The sing=
ularity<br>
&gt; &gt; security policy at<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/s=
ecurity-policy/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.sylabs.io=
/singularity/security-policy/</a><br>
&gt; &gt; already says they will always get a CVE for a vulnerability, and =
it<br>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t say that doesn&#39;t apply to older releases, so assu=
me it does<br>
&gt; &gt; apply.=C2=A0 It also says that they will say in the announcement =
which<br>
&gt; &gt; releases are affected.=C2=A0 How about if they further say that t=
hey will<br>
&gt; &gt; provide a patch for older versions if it is easy, but not promise=
 to<br>
&gt; &gt; create a new release based on non-current open source versions?=
=C2=A0 I know<br>
&gt; &gt; that squid has sometimes provided security patches for older vers=
ions<br>
&gt; &gt; without making a new release.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Singularity team &amp; Sylabs: are you willing to amend your secu=
rity policy<br>
&gt; &gt; to say that if the latest version is not vulnerable that you&#39;=
ll at least<br>
&gt; &gt; provide a source code patch for the newest vulnerable release, if=
 the<br>
&gt; &gt; patch is small?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think most open source projects would at least notify=
 everyone if an<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exploit is found in only older releases and advise ever=
yone to upgrade<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the latest version as the fix.=C2=A0 Is this not suf=
ficient for Debian&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stable?=C2=A0 Is the assumption that any security fix h=
as to be a minimum<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change to the stable version, and not an upgrade to a v=
ersion with new<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functionality?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All I know about that is what&#39;s written here:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.debian.org/security/faq#o=
ldversion" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.debian.org/secu=
rity/faq#oldversion</a><br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That clearly allows for exceptions.=C2=A0 It says<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0In some cases it is not possible to backport a=
 security fix, for<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0example when large amounts of source code need=
 to be modified or<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0rewritten. If that happens it might be necessa=
ry to move to a new<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0upstream version, but this has to be coordinat=
ed with the security<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0team beforehand.<br>
&gt; &gt; That sounds quite a lot like what the singularity security policy=
 is<br>
&gt; &gt; saying.=C2=A0 If they develop a fix for the latest release, and i=
t would be<br>
&gt; &gt; hard to do it for an older release, they could just recommend tha=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; everyone upgrade to the latest version.=C2=A0 If the Debian packa=
ge provider<br>
&gt; &gt; also thinks it is too much work to backport, he or she would need=
 to ask<br>
&gt; &gt; the Debian security team for an exception, and if they agreed it =
is too<br>
&gt; &gt; hard they would grant it.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The Debian Q&amp;A also says it is most important to maintain sta=
bility for<br>
&gt; &gt; library APIs, which is not an issue with this package.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are there other significant open source packages that s=
tay only in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Debian Unstable; is this acceptable to users?=C2=A0 I b=
elieve that it can be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a major pain for them, since it often requires newer ve=
rsions of all<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dependent libraries.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I /think/ firefox is like that (as opposed to firefox-esr, w=
hich is what<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ends up in Stable). But some people do use Unstable and mayb=
e a<br>
&gt; &gt; combination<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Testing and Unstable, but you&#39;d have to be vigilant a=
nd know what<br>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Yes it would be quite a burden on users to ask them to get singul=
arity<br>
&gt; &gt; only from Unstable.=C2=A0 firefox doesn&#39;t sound like a good e=
xample because<br>
&gt; &gt; there is firefox-esr.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there an alternative widely used repository availabl=
e?=C2=A0 Red Hat<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enterprise Linux has EPEL, and they normally want to ke=
ep the first two<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; release numbers of packages to stay stable per OS versi=
on as well, but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exceptions can be granted there if a backport patch is =
not available.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We have stable-backports, but packages are only allowed ther=
e if they&#39;re<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; destined for the next Stable--to ensure an upgrade path betw=
een releases.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is a clear difference between the Debian and Fedora/EPEL/Cen=
tOS<br>
&gt; &gt; communities, and I think it is unfortunate.=C2=A0 Some packages t=
hat are in<br>
&gt; &gt; Fedora stay in EPEL forever and never make it to RHEL/CentOS.=C2=
=A0 I think<br>
&gt; &gt; it would be good to have some mechanism for similar packages in D=
ebian.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure how readily an exception is granted for lac=
k of a patch in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Debian, but it can cause disruption even if it is granted. B=
rowsers are<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; given exceptions-- firefox-esr (which even still has major r=
elease<br>
&gt; &gt; updates<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Stable) and chromium, which can break packaged browser ex=
tensions,<br>
&gt; &gt; etc.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I could ask specifically about getting potential exceptions =
for<br>
&gt; &gt; Singularity,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it was never mentioned as a possibility when the securit=
y team<br>
&gt; &gt; reached<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Please do.=C2=A0 Talk specifically about the situation for 3.x on=
ly. I don&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; think there should be expectations for continued security support=
 for<br>
&gt; &gt; 2.x for very long because of the difficulty of backporting fixes.=
<br>
&gt; &gt; Backports between different 3.x levels when a security fix comes =
in a<br>
&gt; &gt; new 3.x.y release should be much easier at that point in general =
because<br>
&gt; &gt; of the common language.=C2=A0 Of course this means that Debian pa=
ckaging for<br>
&gt; &gt; 3.x needs to get completed first.<br>
