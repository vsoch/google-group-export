Hi DengFeng,

The docs show an example for a specific version of MPI (openmpi I believe)
and so logically it's not going to be the exact command for your software.
I don't know about Fluent, but generally the strategy you want to take is
to expose the needed executables and paths inside the container to whatever
processes need to see them on the outside. You can do this by having
controllers either be the runscript (and thus touched when you execute the
image) or by way of binding content in the image to the outside, and having
executables on the path (see singularity help exec and notice the -B/--bind
option as an example). If there is some expected path for fluent, you could
either link it to find the image, or change the expected path entirely to
be the image (if that is possible?)

I can't offer much help in the way of MPI, but if you want help from the
list (and most aren't familiar with Fluent 16) it would be helpful to see:

1.  how you installed it (eg, what the guts of your container look like)
2. how it works/runs without a container
3. how you've tried running it with a container
4. and then of course the error output

I think very likely the issue will be resolved with some correct binding
and making sure things are on the path, but I can't say more beyond that!
And hey, if/when we figure this out, it would be great to have a Fluent
example added to the docs for the next user!

Best,

Vanessa
