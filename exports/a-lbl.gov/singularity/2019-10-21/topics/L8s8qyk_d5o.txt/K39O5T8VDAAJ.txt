Hi Reid,

Nice writeup!

Just a small update (as the work likely occurred after your tech report was=
 written) -

Current master branch can utilize user namespaces to avoid any privileged o=
perations (if you limit the features you use - such as running from a direc=
tory instead of an image).

User namespaces also has a maybe-not-the-greatest track record: while they =
have been around for a few years, they've also been causing CVEs for a few =
years.  RHEL7 only allows them to be enabled via a kernel boot parameter.  =
So, you might encounter a wide spectrum of opinions on the topic.  I person=
ally suspect it'll take another 2 years before really broad deployment.

Unprivileged FUSE mounts look to be incoming over the next year or so; thes=
e afford yet another exciting set of opportunities for this space.

LBNL does Singularity; NERSC does Shifter; LANL does charliecloud.  Locally=
, we do Docker.  Seems like we'd benefit from getting a few folks in a room=
 with a whiteboard.  Many good ideas in this area are blooming.

Brian
