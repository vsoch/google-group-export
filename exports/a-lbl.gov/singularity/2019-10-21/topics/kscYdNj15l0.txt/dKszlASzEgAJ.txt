Please note that there is now a third release candidate for v3.1.0.  A 
bunch of bugs have been identified and fixed from the first two 
candidates.  This is great because every bug that is fixed at this stage is 
one fewer bug in the actual release!  If you have any time to spare and you 
want to help ensure that Singularity v3.1.0 is as stable as possible, 
please download and test this release candidate.  Thanks!
