We plan to take this approach but for the time being have been doing builds
on the production systems.  Our work around of only allowing builds on
compute within interactive jobs should be sufficient until we get a proper
build host.  Our compute have read-only root filesystems served up via NFS
so there is not much someone with root can change if they were to bind
mount locations they shouldn't.

Thanks,
- Trey
