I may be a bit late to the party, but, perhaps our container recipe at 
https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/Singularity-tensorflow may be helpful.

The only issue with it is that since we put a specific GPU driver version 
(in reality just libcuda.so and a few other libs) in the container, the 
host must run the same driver version as well.

the --nv flag with which I am not familiar with yet, should help to bring 
those libraries from the host, or, we also thought on unpacking the driver 
on the host to a specific dir and bind mounting that dir in the container.
