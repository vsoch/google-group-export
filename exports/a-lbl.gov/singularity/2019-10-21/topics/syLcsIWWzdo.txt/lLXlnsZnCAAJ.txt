So we solved this as follows:
1) Create a file and make it executable named after the slurm command with 
e.g.:

echo '#!/bin/bash
ssh $USER@$HOSTNAME squeue $1' >> /usr/local/bin/squeue

2) chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/squeue

This solved it!  Note that you need passwordless ssh and it assumes you are 
running this on the same system with slurm ($USER and $HOSTNAME), but could 
easily be modified.

Here's a full definition file for this solution:
