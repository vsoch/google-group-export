Haha, thanks Greg! At this point, the main docs are on the site at:
http://gmkurtzer.github.io/singularity/docs.html, and as I mentioned in my
previous email they really do need lots more work but any feedback you can
provide on packaging any scientific (or non-scientific) apps would be
greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
