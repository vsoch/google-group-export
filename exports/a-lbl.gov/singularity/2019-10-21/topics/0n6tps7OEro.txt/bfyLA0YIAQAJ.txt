Thanks Greg,

Now if you compiled your OFED libraries in the same place you were bind
> mounting the OpenMPI from on your host, *and* if those libraries were glibc
> compatible with your container (which I am assuming they were, because you

You've surmised correctly! In this case I was running a recent Ubuntu
(16.04) container on an older (CentOS 7) host, with OFED and MPI compiled
with the older CentOS 7 glibc.
I guess my strategy of bind mounting helps me run new software on older
stable cluster nodes, but would not help with the reverse strategy of
running old stable containers for reproducible science on new clusters.

So, is there any functional difference in container integration between
Open MPI 1.x series and Open MPI 2.1 series? I'm not sure which (if any) of
the above assumptions I can relax for 2.1.

@Vanessa: That helps, but you didn't notice that I submitted that PR to you
;-) I want to update it to make sure that its crystal clear what the Open
MPI 2.1 series enables and what the differences with the Open MPI 1.x and
2.0 series is (at the moment I can't find any when using bind mounts and
container glibc > host glibc, so the example should work for 1.10 as well
as 2.1 although I need to verify)


> Hope that helps, and yes on the PR to the docs! PLEASE!
>

 Definitely!

Cheers,

Chris.
