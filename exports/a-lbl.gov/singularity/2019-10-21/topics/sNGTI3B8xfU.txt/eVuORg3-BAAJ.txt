Hi everyone,

I was experimenting with inheritance and before proceeding with some=20
fixes and refactoring it=E2=80=99s better to get some feedback.
The main reasoning behind such functionality is that a basic definition=20
can be used to create more complex workflows, similarly to how #include=20
is used in C/C++ and other programming languages/platforms.
To give you an example of how it currently works let's say we have two=20
definition files:

parent.def:

BootStrap: yum
OSVersion: 7
MirrorURL:=20
http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
Include: yum
%runscript
     echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."
%post
     echo "Hello from inside the container"
     yum -y install vim-minimal

and child.def:

Inherit: parent.def
BootStrap: yum
OSVersion: 6
MirrorURL:=20
http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
Include: bash
%runscript
     echo "This is what happens when you run the container with an=20
inherit command..."
%post
     echo "This container inherits from another container"
     yum -y install bash-completion

This would create an intermediate temp definition which is passed for=20
bootstrapping.
The temporary definition file would look like this:

BootStrap: yum
OSVersion: 7
MirrorURL:=20
http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
Include: yum bash
%runscript
     echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."
     echo "This is what happens when you run the container with an=20
inherit command..."
%post
     echo "Hello from inside the container"
     yum -y install vim-minimal
     echo "This container inherits from another container"
     yum -y install bash-completion

Some remarks/clarifications:

1. Currently there's no built-in limit on the depth of inheritance but=20
the deepest definition is considered the main parent.
2. The main parent's BootStrap, OSVersion, MirrorURL and UpdateURL=20
keywords take priority over all other definitions.
3. The Inherit keyword can contain multiple definitions, but the first=20
definition will always be considered the parent or
the one which leads to the parent. ie.
Inherit: def1 def2 def3
def1 is the parent unless it inherits from other definitions as well.
4. Packages from the Include keyword are concatenated.
5. Sections (runscript, post, test) are combined but this could=20
potentially be changed to create multiple posts or tests.
6. No docker bootstrap support at the moment.

Many thanks to Greg for earlier feedback and advise about some potential=20
issues.
Any comments/feedback are greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Chris
