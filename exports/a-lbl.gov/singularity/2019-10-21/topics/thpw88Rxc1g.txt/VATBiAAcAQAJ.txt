Hi Chris,

What if you just use cleanenv? The user could still mount home, but not
have the influence of the (external) home environment. Eg:

>
> *singularity shell --cleanenv docker://ubuntu*
> Docker image path: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest
> Cache folder set to /home/vanessa/.singularity/docker
> Creating container runtime...
> Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...
> Singularity ubuntu:~> env
> SHELL=/bin/bash
> TERM=xterm
> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/.singularity.d/libs
> SINGULARITY_NAME=ubuntu
> PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
> PWD=/home/vanessa
> LANG=C
> PS1=Singularity ubuntu:\w>
> SHLVL=1
> HOME=/home/vanessa
> SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=ubuntu
> _=/usr/bin/env


Note that none of the 10,000 variables defined on my host are present in
the container. You would then want to provide whatever paths / variables
*are* needed inside the container via a custom %environment, etc. Would
that work?

Best,

Vanessa
