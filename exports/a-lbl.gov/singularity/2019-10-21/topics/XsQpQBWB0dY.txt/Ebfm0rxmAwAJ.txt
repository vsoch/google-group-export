Dear Vanessa,

thanks for your help.=20
Not sure I understood correctly what you suggest. Is it possible to have=20
singularity container being built in docker hub? Or to do that I need to=20
re-write my singularity base recipe file to docker one? Hope this is not=20
the case.
If I may ask, did you figure out why the build times out? Is it because=20
there is a maximum time allowed for each build? If so, can this be=20
increased? My container base has longer build time than normal because it=
=20
build from sources some tools/libraries not available/suitable yet as=20
system packages.
I also tried to turn on the debug mode but I was not able to actually see a=
=20
verbose build output. I will check again.
Another question: is it possible to have singularity container files (built=
=20
by users) hosted on the SingularityHub (say a maximum amount of space per=
=20
user)? I mean no pipeline build required, only public storage on shub.

Thanks again,

SImone
