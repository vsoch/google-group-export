What is the error? The first bit about the CPU supporting instructions that
the binary can't use is just a warning
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47068709/your-cpu-supports-instructions-that-this-tensorflow-binary-was-not-compiled-to-u>
I think. After that it shows finding the GPU. Could you be more specific
about what the error is that you are seeing?

There shouldn&#39;t be any dialog box that pops up when building the contai=

Hi Marty, I actually tried that first - but in the process a dialogue box c=

keyboard are not mapped to the display it seems and I am not able to procee=

I tried a few other recipes as well from Singularity Hub, haven&#39;t yet b=

Not a specific one, but if you search for the label that is the cuda versio=

It looks like you are pointing at a non-existent repository or mirror for t=

the URL you are pointing at.<br>

I am not a ubuntu person but rather centos but you should be able to point =
