Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity security problem?
To: singularity@lbl.gov

Hi David,

I think the really interesting exploits would happen not when the
images are created - but as they are changed by the arbitrary user
process running outside the container.

One can imagine there are undiscovered race conditions when the
filesystem image is modified while it is mounted.

I wonder if there's a new feature needed which allows one to `pull` an
image but not allow it to be modified by the unprivileged user?  It'd
be a nice compromise between the default mode and limiting users to
only using image directories.

Brian
