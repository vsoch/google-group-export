Hey Robert,

I think it might be that simple? An iso file is not the same as a
singularity image, so no you cannot just change the extensions and use
simeotaneously. That said, I'm not actually familiar with iso format, and
I'll take a look in free time with dinner! In case you are interested, the
new quickstart (and all updated docs) are on docs/2.3 branch here:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/blob/master/pages/docs/user-docs/docs-quick-start-installation.md

To answer your question, you would build an image however you like, and
then just plop it on a cluster node, and shell / run / exec commands to it.
You wouldn't mount it typically on your cluster, but you can bind your data
paths to it with --bind/-B. And yes, don't put stuff in /tmp that you care
about :)

Best,

Vanessa
