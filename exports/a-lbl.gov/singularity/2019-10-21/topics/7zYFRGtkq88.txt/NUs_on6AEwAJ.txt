Hello! 

Can you clarify what you meant by " I can only run with unprivileged user 
(root)"? Do you mean that you only run as root inside the container? Or do 
you mean you cannot run as root inside the container? How are you launching 
the container? Are you calling it as "sudo singularity cent-7.img" or 
"singularity cent-7.img?"

In my experience, you can only run as a privileged user inside a container 
if you are a privileged user inside the container. Additionally, I've had 
poor luck building and installing Singularity on RHEL/CENTOS systems. 
Instead, I build all my singularity programs on latest Ubuntu, package it 
as an RPM, then "sudo yum install singularity.tar.gz". Perhaps doing that 
will fix your issue?
