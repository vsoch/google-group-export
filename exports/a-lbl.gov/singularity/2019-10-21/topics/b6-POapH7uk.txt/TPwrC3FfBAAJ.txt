Hi,
    It seems that with version 2.2.1 "BIND PATH" directories specified in 
singularity.conf are not bound during the bootstrap process. I think it's 
reasonable to expect that in the %post section of the definition that these 
specified directories are bound and in previous versions of Singularity 
this has been the case. Is this the expected behavior moving forward or a 
bug? Is there any workaround for mounting these directories in %post ?

Thanks,
Adam
