Yes, this is exactly correct with my experience.

Yes, I think there is, but nothing I can state definitively. I had a talk
with some of the OMPI devels a while back and they mentioned some
advantages, specifically versioning handshake along the PMI which would
help with version mismatches between host and containers. But don't quote
me if that is working properly in the 2.x series, nor do I know if there
are enough 2.x releases to adequately test this.
