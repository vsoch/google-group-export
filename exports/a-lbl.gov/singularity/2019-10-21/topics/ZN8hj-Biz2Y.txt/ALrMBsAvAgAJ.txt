Hey Oriol!

In a nutshell, yes - one of the features of Singularity is seamlessness bet=
ween the container and environment of the host, and this is very different =
from other container solutions (e.g. Docker) and one of the reasons it work=
s really great for scientific computing. You can fine turn which software g=
ets used by way of PATH or by calling the executable directly (the latter i=
s usually my preference). If you have specific use cases or example workflo=
ws that you want help with, feel free to post on here and we can walk throu=
gh different things to try.

Best,

Vanessa
