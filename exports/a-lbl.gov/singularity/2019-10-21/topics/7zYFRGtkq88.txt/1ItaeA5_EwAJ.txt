Hello,

This is Chih-Song, HPC Benchmark Specialist from Fujitsu.

After several days of trials and errors I realized that the OS kernel seems 
to have an impact on the ability to run Singularity as unprivileged user.
Centos-7 container on RHEL-6 host: I can only run with unprivileged user 
(root)
Centos-6 container on RHEL-6 host: I can run with privileged and 
unprivileged user
The sudoers file and the installation path of Singularity are the same in 
both settings.

Has anyone experienced the same situation?

BTW, the Q&A mentioned that "note: If you require kernel dependent 
features, a container platform is probably not the right solution for 
you.There is also some level of glibc forward compatibility that must be 
taken into consideration for any container system." Is this issue related 
to the one I am reporting?

To the developers: Does such limitation exist by intention or am I 
discovering a potential bug?
