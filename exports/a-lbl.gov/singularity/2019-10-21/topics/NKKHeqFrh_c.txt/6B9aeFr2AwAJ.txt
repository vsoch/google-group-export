If you like /use Google Cloud you can check out the builders!

https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/client-google-compute

You can customize your builders with a config.json, and we can also add
other backends to the library <https://singularityhub.github.io/builders>
if this is desired (for example, if you have some kind of cluster, AWS, or
just local resource). For other services it's just a matter of working with
the various APIs. I'm planning on doing a simple workflow for Singularity
Registry Server to do:

recipe in github repo --> continuous integration (with testing) to build
--> push to Singularity Registry Server
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry>

Working on the middle bit right now. Actually, the problem is much simpler
than that, when you think about it, and this is what makes it so fun! We
generally have:

*recipe under version control* ---> *build and test *--> *storage* -->
*retrieve*

which means as academic and research groups, we have great flexibility to
customize each of those steps, mix and match, and switch out when we change
our minds. Which you know, never happens right? :P
