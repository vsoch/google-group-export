Hi Oliver,

We haven't generally incremented the version / changed the debian changelog
for a point release until it's tagged as an official release and we are
ready to build the release tarball. We are currently on release candidate
tags here, where it was assumed for testing that they would be pulled from
git by tag, and built from source which gives the git commit in the version
output.

If you feel RCs should be included in the debian/changelog, and have a
reference for the correct procedure to take r.e. debian changelog with
release candidates, that would be appreciated.

Many Thanks,

DT
