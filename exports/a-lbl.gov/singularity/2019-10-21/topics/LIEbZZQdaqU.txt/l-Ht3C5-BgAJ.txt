Hi Martin,

Thanks for the kind words, and it would be great to add some of your tricks
to the documentation proper! For Singularity Hub, would you want a better
search page that would let you filter based on ... [ what do you want to
filter for? ]

We can definitely improve the UI - I agree it shouldn't be hard to find
what you are looking for. Right now there is no sophisticated way tag or
define what is in a container, but this is something that I can think about
and implement.

Looking forward to seeing all your tricks!

Best,

Vanessa
