Hi,

 I am successfully running singularity using tar.gz containers on a Linux 
Mint 18 system (user name space enabled) in unprivileged mode:

 singularity exec -u -p vre.tar.gz /bin/bash

When I try to load the container writable I do not get an error:

 sudo singularity exec -w -u -c -p vre.tar.gz /bin/bash

...but the changes are not stored back in the container.

I do not even get an error when I do the following:

 singularity exec -w -u -c -p vre.tar.gz /bin/bash and write in a location 
within the container where my user has write access permissions.

whereas when I start singularity with a container image it would fail:

 singularity exec -w -u -c -p vre.img /bin/bash

telling me that only root is allowed to write the container image


Now these are my questions:

1.) Would it be doable/difficult to implement writing back changes for 
container archives for root?

2.) Would it be possible to implement user write access? Does this raise 
security concerns? I got it that way that using image containers it is 
technically not doable?

3.) Is there somewhere a more detailed explanation of differences between 
container images and container archives/directories, their respective 
limitations and properties?

thanks a lot
Stefan
