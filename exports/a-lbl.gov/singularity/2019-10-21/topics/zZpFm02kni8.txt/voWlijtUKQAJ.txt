Thanks for the quick response.

I'll start by saying I'd be more than willing to test the v2.x branch. I'm
right down the street from you folks ( Emeryville.)

I'm still a bit confused as to these relative paths and the differences
between the sections like %files and %packages.

when I do a build, should I be sitting in a working dir which already
contains the necessary files?

As far as python is concerned, the "packages" are all just files, so I
assume I'd stick all the necessary things there?

Would I then do a %runscript to do the conda installs and the Exec: do run
the final python script...

Feeling pretty stupid at this point. Thanks for the patience.

Thomas.
