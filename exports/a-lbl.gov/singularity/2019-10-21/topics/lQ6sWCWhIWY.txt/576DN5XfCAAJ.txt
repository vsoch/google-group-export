Hi,
thanks for the infos. I'm also eager to see the video presentation

Still I have a question.
I've played around with Debian/Buster: singularity 3.0.3 and openmpi 3.1.3
and pmix 3.1.2 (from system packages).
As expected a singularity container with Xenial (openmpi 1.10.2) is not
working.
But singularity container with Cosmic (openmpi 2.1.1 with or
without pmix 2.1)

Following Victor comments and from the refrence doc on PMIX, I though that
it should have been working for Cosmic image with pmix 2.1...
Am I right?

Next, for Xenial and Cosmic image I still can run mpirun within the
containers..
Is it safe to do that or not?
Note that I'm planing to use a SMP machine with Debian/stretch in that case

Thanks for your explanations and/or comments
Best
C.
