Hi all,

I've been working on a bunch of new features and have been committing them
to the master branch in github. If you want the stable release, you should
pull from the 2.x branch.

If you want to test the new features in master that would also be great!
But I'm not guaranteeing bug freeness. HAHA... Some of the features include:

- Master configuration file to control mounts
- Daemon process and namespace sharing (start/stop commands now available)
- Lots of code cleanups, changes, optimizations, etc..
- Among others....

Thanks!
