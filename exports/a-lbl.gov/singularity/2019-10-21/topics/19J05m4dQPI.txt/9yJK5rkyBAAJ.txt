I want to collect a lot of system configuration and  other settings during 
setup, post, runscript, environment .... of the container in the cleanest 
way possible. 
Obviously i can have variables all over the containers and save the output 
to a file, but it will be hard to  control them and update them (they will 
be so many). Ideally something like:

%runscript
    CPU version here
    SOckets..


%post
    Build number

%environment
 compiler version
%someSection where this can execute during %post, %runscript, %setup and 
all the sections of the containers
CPU    = read during %runscript 
uArch  = 
Sockets =
Cores  =
HT     
Memory 
compiler version = read during %environment 
build number....

Any idea what would be the best way to achieve this?

Thank you
