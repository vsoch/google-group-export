I'm not sure about user namespaces. But it seems as though we are very 
close to what we need; using singularity build works on the image file, but 
all of my special user files are now owned by root. All that would be 
needed would be for some way to be able to specify a mapping between users 
during the build process. 

Possibly more than one user could be mapped (flattened) onto the same user 
in the singularity image, though this would be a bit unusual.
