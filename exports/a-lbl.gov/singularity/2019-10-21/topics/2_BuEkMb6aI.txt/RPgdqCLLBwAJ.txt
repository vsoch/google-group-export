Hi everyone,

Up to now I confgured all binds statically in 
/etc/singularity/singularity.conf but that does not seem to be such a good 
idea on long terms.
I want to spawn a cloned instance of the running container process via ssh 
on neighbour compute node.
For instance I am calling initially via

singularity exec -b couple -b of -b custom -binds /my/container.img 
/custom/path/jobscript.sh

where jobscript internally calls:
ssh neighbournode 'singularity $SINGULARITY_IMAGE $params'

 Is there a simple way to obtain the cmdline of how the singularity 
container was invoked from within the container? Or at least the bind 
mounts?
As far as I can see there are a couple of predefined envvars but none that 
refer to bind mounts, right?

thanks and greets
Stefan
