Hey Greg,

I just presented at the Lustre User Group meeting about an automation platf=
orm driven by file system events. The use case we developed was user-define=
d metadata extraction using Singularity under the hood. Singularity worked =
well for this because the processes doing the extraction can all be done in=
 user space, and users can manage a suite of portable images so the same ex=
traction can happen on different systems.
