I just started this script this morning and am about to jump on a plane, 
but wanted to share quickly, because (I think) it will be useful! It's a 
script to export a docker image via running to singularity:

https://github.com/vsoch/singularity-tools/blob/master/docker/docker2singularity.sh

It would probably be annoying for people to have to generate Singularity 
equivalent Docker files for images, but just being able to export a Docker 
image seems like a solid way to start! The only test I've done is to create 
ubuntu images for ubuntu:14.04 and ubuntu:latest and the containers create 
and I can connect to them successfully. I'll be making the script take in 
proper arguments, and further:

- programatically determining the size
- some integration of setting to set up a runscript
- can we programatically get more meta data / etc about the images to also 
help making the DESCRIPTION and MAINTAINER files?

It's a bit alarming that more information isn't readily available about 
what is included in an image via docker inspect. Perhaps Singularity can do 
better by generating some data structure to live with the image that better 
summarizes this. Likely developers don't have this immediate need to just 
deploy some Dockerized app, but for researchers it's very important to be 
able to do things like computationally compare different images. Given that 
I'm looking for an image to perform some need, I'd want to be able to 
immediately generate some kind of unsupervised clustering of images based 
on these things.

Another detail about the singularity-images repo - this is a great idea, 
but depending on the size of the images (given we have OS here) it might go 
over the Github file size limit (50MB), and further each user only gets 1GB 
for Github LFS. If it doesn't work, perhaps Github can be used to submit 
PRs and discuss new images, but then when they are added, they can be 
transferred to some other equivalent. In the long term we would want that 
other equivalent to have functionality akin to Docker Hub, but a lot 
better, heh :)

I'd like to help out making these images - I'm new to singularity and I'm 
just figuring out the basics. I'm leaving for a trip today but will be back 
to working on this soon, bon voyage! :D

Best,

Vanessa
