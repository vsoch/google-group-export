Hello there, 

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience of using Singularity on IBM 
POWER architecture? Or if there would be expected issues with 
installing/running Singularity on that kind of machine. 

We will soon be getting access to a new cluster which is being built with 
IBM POWER8 architecture. Having used Singularity for a little while on our 
current x86 HPC, I was hoping we could get Singularity installed on the new 
POWER cluster and just transfer our images for smooth transition of all our 
research tools. 

I don't know much about the differences between architectures or how that 
impacts software running on the machine, so any information would be 
helpful. 

Cheers
//Adrian
