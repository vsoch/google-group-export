Hi Augusto,

I am also facing the same situation in my armv7 development box.=20

I set the memory.limit_in_bytes value to 150MB for particular app. The app=
=20
is trying to run within 150MB only. And sometimes it is reaching close to=
=20
150 and getting freezed.
If I don't set the memory limit, the app is taking around 180MB and running=
=20
smoothly.=20

My query is why the app is limiting to allocate the memory (i.e. 150MB)=20
which is specified in memory.limit_in_bytes value.=20
Also why it is not getting killed by OOM and running with memory close to=
=20
limit value.

Are  you still facing the issue which you mentioned. Please tell if you=20
find any solution.

Thanks.

Regards,
Nambi Rajan.
