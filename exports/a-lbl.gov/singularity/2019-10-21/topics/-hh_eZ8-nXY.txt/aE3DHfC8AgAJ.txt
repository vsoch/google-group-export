Hi Mike,

Thanks for replying DT and Vanessa.  Sylabs (the entity that guides the
Singularity project) is also working on a cloud library, a remote builder,
and a keystore for signing and verification.

https://cloud.sylabs.io/library
https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder
https://cloud.sylabs.io/keystore

These are all very, very much *alpha* right now and are not expected to be
stable.  But the long-term plan is for all of these services to be
production-grade and hosted by Sylabs for public use.  There will also be
premium features available for Singularity Pro subscribers.  This includes
the ability to host these services on-prem when needed.

Afaik, all of these services are expected to go into general release in the
next few months.  If you want more info about becoming a Singularity Pro
subscriber ping me directly at d...@sylabs.io

Dave

I left before it went into production though, so can&#39;t confirm the usag=

 a master install somewhere, and using external tools to synchronize the da=
tabase and files to read-only mirrors at other sites. That could allow the =
heavy download operations to be performed locally, but getting tokens etc. =
would have to be done on the (possibly remote) master. Also, I&#39;m not re=
ally sure how it would handle lag on filesystem replication of containers. =
I don&#39;t think there is anything that would check for consistency before=
 serving an image - but I may be wrong there.<br></div><div><br></div><div>=
With regard to playing around the VM - to get useful performance with simul=
taneous connections I had to tweak both UWSGI and NGINX configuration. I be=
lieve I was allowing 48 UWSGI procs and 48 NGINX worker processes on a fair=
ly beefy machine. This was prior to Vanessa changing the uploads to be offl=
oaded to NGINX. Large uploads/downloads are going to block a uwsgi and/or n=
ginx process, so you will need the max numbers for those set high enough. <=
