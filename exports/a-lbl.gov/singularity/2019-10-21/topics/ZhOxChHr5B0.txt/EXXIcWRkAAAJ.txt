To: singularity@lbl.gov

Hi,

  Has your definition file changed since you originally posted it? In
the definition file you're doing ...

    cd ompi
    # Build OpenMPI in the working directory
      [ ... ]
    # Install STAR -  get STAR source using git
    git clone https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR.git
    cd STAR/source

  So... from my reading of that, you're checking the STAR source out,
into the ompi clone, as you're never changing from the ompi
directory....

  I'm guessing that path is:  /root/ompi/STAR

  You are also not doing a "make install" after STAR is built... so
the STAR binary is probably just sitting in the STAR source
directory...

-J
