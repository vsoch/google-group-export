This is in the development version of Singularity and will be a feature
available in the 2.2 release. Yes, it will work with a standard directory
that contains an installation of Linux.

I am moving Singularity to a stacked library architecture which is very
modular and easy to add features without changing or impacting others. So
adding support other modules for the "rootfs" is actually pretty easy.

No docs on this yet as it is still in development. In a nutshell (and as
you can see from my snippet example) you simply replace the image path that
you currently use in Singularity for the directory path.

The directory feature will work with all Kernel versions.

Yes, exactly. Singularity will also have the ability to deal with archives
(tar.gz files, etc..). This feature isn't present yet, but as I mentioned
above, will be fairly trivial to add.

>

Nope, path of the directory does not matter from host to host.

Thank you,

Well, yes and no. Yes in that there is slightly more overhead in the loop
bind of the image which will save about 5-7 thousandths of a second when
using a base directory, but you may quickly loose that benefit with dealing
with parallel container execution when the container is on a network file
system (especially a parallel file system) as metadata lookups are
expensive. For large scale parallel runs, it makes much more sense to use
images.

Hopefully that helps, but let me know if anything else needs clarification.

Greg
