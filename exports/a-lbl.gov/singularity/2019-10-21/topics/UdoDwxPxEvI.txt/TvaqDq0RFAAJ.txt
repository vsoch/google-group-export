Hi Dave,

  Well..  This is completely crazy. =20

  I tried to run singularity with the --contain option:  singularity shell=
=20
--contain sregistry.simg

I get the following:

ERROR  : Multiple devpts instances unsupported and "mount devpts" configure=
d
ABORT  : Retval =3D 255

So, I tried to run the container on another CentOS 6 system that has a=20
different home directory on our shared cluster storage for myself with=20
nothing python related in my home directory...  I get the same failures.
A third system (VM with local home directory) that I use for basic dev=20
testing, same CentOS 6 image but empty home.  It works.

I don't have any python virtualenv's in my home directory.  I have some=20
directories that are expanded tarballs from pypi, but I'm not a huge python=
=20
user.

In my /etc/singularity/singularity.conf file, we have the following set:


allow setuid =3D yes
max loop devices =3D 256
allow pid ns =3D yes
config passwd =3D yes
config group =3D yes
config resolv_conf =3D yes
mount proc =3D yes
mount sys =3D yes
mount dev =3D yes
mount devpts =3D yes
mount home =3D yes
mount tmp =3D yes
mount hostfs =3D no
bind path =3D /etc/localtime
bind path =3D /etc/hosts
bind path =3D /gpfs
bind path =3D /fs
bind path =3D /.local/work
bind path =3D /work
bind path =3D /ceph
user bind control =3D yes
enable overlay =3D try
mount slave =3D yes
sessiondir max size =3D 16
allow container dir =3D yes
allow container extfs =3D yes
allow container squashfs =3D yes

I am using the puppet forge module to configure singularity.conf.  Our=20
environment is very customized at the current time.  I am trying to use=20
Singularity to contain the customization into the container allowing us to=
=20
make the bare-metal image sane.  I also tried to build an image from the=20
sregistry-cli recipe available on Singularity Hub.  I got the exact same=20
behavior....
