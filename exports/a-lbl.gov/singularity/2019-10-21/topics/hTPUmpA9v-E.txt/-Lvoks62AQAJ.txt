Yes, please file an issue! And actually put it on the main Singularity

&gt; *SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHDIR *addresses the issue of being able to write =
at runtime to local directories. Read the rationale here: <a href=3D"https:=
//github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/604#issuecomment-294379830"=

re/singularity/<wbr>issues/604#issuecomment-<wbr>294379830</a><br>
Understood! I did now also do some tests.<br>
<br>
Running:<br>
SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=3D$(pwd)/tmp SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=3D$(pwd)/<wbr>cache si=
ngularity -vvv build=C2=A0 fos.img minimal.def<br>
(with &quot;minimal.def&quot; boostrapping from Docker).<br>
<br>
I observe the following:<br>
$(pwd)/tmp/.singularity-build.<wbr>NbsdAx<br>
is created during build, holding the container root, as expected. This is t=
emporary and removed afterwards, all fine :-).<br>
<br>
Additionally:<br>
$(pwd)/cache/docker<br>
contains the tarballs from the Docker layers, and is kept persistent. Also =
perfectly fine :-).<br>
<br>
However, the communication file:<br>
/tmp/.singularity-layers.<wbr>GMwGRqyD<br>
is shortly present in &quot;/tmp&quot;. This location seems to be hardcoded=
 (see <a href=3D"https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/2.4/li=
bexec/handlers/image-docker.sh#L27" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">ht=
tps://github.com/<wbr>singularityware/singularity/<wbr>blob/2.4/libexec/han=
dlers/<wbr>image-docker.sh#L27</a> ),<br>
but since that just seems to contain the list of layers, that&#39;s not rea=
lly an issue (would be nice though if SINGULARITY_TMPDIR would be honoured)=
.<br>
<br>
So all in all, it seems to really work as expected - at first I misidentifi=
ed the &quot;/tmp/.singularity-layers.<wbr>GMwGRqyD&quot; as being somethin=
g like the extracted layers, I did not look closely enough ;-).<br>
<br>
<br>
So after this is all clear, my request would still be to document at least =
these two variables (and maybe more?) in the frame of &quot;singularity bui=
ld&quot;,<br>
since they are essential to set up build hosts (for example, we will now pu=
t an extra partition with several GB in our VM to contain SINGULARITY_CACHE=
DIR to reduce the load on DockerHub).<br>
If we would use the SquashFS-images, we would also set SINGULARITY_TMPDIR t=
o some ramdisk location to speed up the build tremendously (now we do that =
with --sandbox in any case).<br>
<br>
Should I file an issue for these doc updates, so you can do it at any most =
convenient time slot?<br>

&gt; Yeah, we&#39;re terrible programmers. But it&#39;s getting better, eve=
ryone is working hard! Please submit a PR and make it right! Your contribut=
ion is greatly appreciated!<br>
</span>I think part of that is also this funny effect that when reading for=
eign code (and singularity code is foreign to me) you always get the feelin=
g you are reading something badly programmed ;-).<br>
This also holds for your own code if you let it alone for a few years, I ex=
perienced this myself often enough ;-).<br>
At the current point of my life, I&#39;m on the &quot;operations&quot; team=
, though, so I have only very limited time for PRs, but if I find time, I&#=
39;ll surely invest it! :-)<br>

&gt; *SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR: *(the variable I was talking about) is for imag=
e /content/, layers, and metadata, mostly relevant for Docker.<br>
&gt; and *SINGULARITY_TMPDIR*/=C2=A0/seems to be, I agree, used differently=
 in different context.<br>
<span class=3D"">&gt;<br>
&gt; To address your concerns:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0This then later appears to be used as the temporary=
 directory to extract the docker layers to (for building from a docker base=
 image).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0It&#39;s the second that is used, not any local cache directory.=
 If anything, the layers go into SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR and any kind of commu=
nication type files (eg python hands off a list to its caller) might go int=
o one of the other two, to be cleaned up.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0This in the end means I, as user, would have to adj=
ust &quot;SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHEDIR&quot; to specify the temporary director=
y for extracting the Docker layers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think you can just set SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0While the tarballs from the layer are persistent, I=
 guess the extracted layers are not, so the user-exposed &quot;SINGULARITY_=
LOCALCACHEDIR&quot; seems to related to a temporary information.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; that is correct. It&#39;s just temporary for internal communication.<b=
r>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Something similar happens in the other examples I l=
inked, sometimes just changing the variable names which is really confusing=
.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yeah, we&#39;re terrible programmers. But it&#39;s getting better, eve=
ryone is working hard! Please submit a PR and make it right! Your contribut=

&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Maybe somebody can clarify this - if things would r=
eally work in the way that &quot;SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR&quot; is the &quot;on=
e and only&quot; variable to define the place for the long-lived / persiste=
nt cache,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It is :)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0and &quot;SINGULARITY_TMPDIR&quot; would be used to=
 define the place for temporary stuff (e.g. directory tree before SquashFS&=
#39;ing it), that would be really great.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ll let @gmk chime in on this, but I think that&#39;s (already) t=
he idea. The cache is for layers, tmpdir is for runtime, and the local one =
is another (poorly named) version of the tmpdir to work around some permiss=
ions issues.<br>
