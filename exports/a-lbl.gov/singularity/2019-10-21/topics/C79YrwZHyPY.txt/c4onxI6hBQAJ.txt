Hi Vanessa,

Thanks for your quick response! I've collected all the information I can 
regarding configuration. I think the most likely cause is either Travis not 
triggering the Auto-Deployment integration, or the Auto-Deployment 
integration not triggering the singularity webhook. In the Auto-Deployment 
it is necessary to configure an environment to deploy to, I've set this to 
be 'singularity', previously I had it empty and this was causing the 
integration to fail, I'm just running a new build on travis to see if this 
resolves the issue.

All information should be included in this gist:
