I like the clear distinction into sections - this is different from the
obvious comparator (Docker) for which you put everything into one dump. The
one bit that is potentially missing (and useful) is the ability to start
from another image, eg "FROM gmkurtzer/tensorflow" (add my stuff) to reduce
redundancy when writing these specs. The test command is also great -
anything to encourage running tests on software is a huge +1!


>    * Are there other bits of metadata that should be considered?
>

I think that images should have a similar output when you inspect them as
Docker does, either something stored in the header or a static file stored
in the base. For example., the docker2singularity currently just dumps the
output from inspect into a file in ~.

Likely they would be included with them in Github repos? I think we should
nail down this spec, and then produce a crap ton of these files (would be
good to be able to generate them easily, automatically from Docker images)
in a Singularity (app) repo, then we can advertise to folk that they are
available. Thy will also be very useful for developing Singularity Hub :)
