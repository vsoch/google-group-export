Remy,  I completely agree with your point regarding the term 'latest'.
Yes indeed - in fields like CFD it is common for engineers to use a
specific version of a simulation package. If a later release is made
available by the company or authors producing the software, there will be a
reluctance to use it till that release is verfied by running the same case
and checking the results do not change (too much). Simply saying "use the
latest version available" is a dumb thing to do, and if you fly on
aircraft/drive cars etc. you might want to be concerned about the output
being correct!

The concept of metadata in a parseable format like that is fantastic.
I went to a talk by one of the autoros of the Common Workflow Language last
year, but my head hurt after a bit. I think it has applications well
outside the bio filed though, as you have workflows in engineering
simulations too.

Vanessa, feel free to call any metadata package by 'fancyname'

><div>in the same way a tag for ubuntu:14.04 generates a singularity image =
named ubuntu-14.04 we squash the version into one string. The next option w=
ould be to have something similar to modules, but then the apps runscript (=
still) loads some user preference:</div><div><br></div><div>/apps/fancyname=
/1.0</div><div>/apps/fancyname/2.0<br></div><div><br></div><div>and then li=
ke you said, link the runscript in the base folder of apps/fancyname to one=
 of those versions. The question I want to know then, is how to install sof=
tware without telling singularity some version? We could either make the ve=
rsion required and enforce the second of the above two, or we could do what=
 is done with unspecified tags, and call it latest.</div><div><br></div><di=
v>/apps/fancyname/latest</div><div><br></div><div>But that is probably misl=
eading, because who knows if it&#39;s latest?</div><div><br></div><div>I th=
ink what we could do is encourage some standard way of specifying version i=
n the folder organization as a best practice (but not required or essential=
) and then leave it up to the user to determine logic. Arguably, we don&#39=
;t really care about what kind of structure the user provides in the apps f=
older (it&#39;s determined by the %appinstall foo section) as long as the %=
apprun section executes something relative to the top folder. That executio=
n thing could either be calling one directly, or some other logic to determ=
ine which one is called. What do others thing? Should we write some kind of=
 suggested best practice into SCI-F, or change the structure / naming schem=
a in some way to embed labels?</div><div><br></div><div>* +1 fancyname! But=

/div><div>I have been working on something I think is very important - a si=
mple format specification for the internal guts of a Singularity image, one=
 that will make it easy to define different modules within your container. =
This is going to be a base to allow for things like:</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>=C2=A0- container curation: each application carries it&#39;s own metada=
ta and identifier, and is easy to distinguish from the host</div><div>=C2=
=A0- integration with services and (gasp) orchestration of multiple contain=
ers! Each internal software module has predictable, known locations for inp=
uts/outputs, and for its own runscript.</div><div>=C2=A0- moving modules be=
tween containers, or importing an entire application without needing to red=
o bootstrap or worrying about overlapping files.</div><div><br></div><div>I=
mportantly, it makes generation of modular containers super easy, just writ=
ing different sections in the bootstrap recipe and it just works.=C2=A0 The=
 goal is to write this up for scientific data, and I want to get as many co=
ntributors as are interested - contributor =3D=3D author. You can comment a=
