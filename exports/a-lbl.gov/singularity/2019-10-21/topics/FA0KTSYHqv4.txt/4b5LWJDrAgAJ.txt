That looks wrong generally.  It would fail for me -- I'm not in a "sudo"
or "root" group, but I can use sudo and docker (via "wheel" and
"docker").  I only needed sudo for the singularity part of the
conversion, not the docker one, when I tried it by hand.  I think you
have to try executing commands and report if they don't work either bare
or with sudo.

Is it documented somewhere what "Size" actually means?  I got the
impression you'd need to run the thing to get the actual size.  I don't
know if you can rely on being able to run df /, but doing that in the
minimal "fedora" image provided by the EPEL6 docker packaging, I see
265945088 B used v. a Size from inspect of 214315878.

All else failing, obviously you'd at most double the time to do the
conversion if you just found the size of the export stream, which might
be faster than writing to a file.

This might be a way to write a /singularity script for a converted
image, but I'm no docker expert and definitely don't understand the
format stuff:

Cmd=$(docker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Cmd}}' $image)
if [[ $Cmd != none ]]; then
  echo '#!/bin/sh'
  (IFS='[],'; echo $Cmd)
fi > singularity

However, there's ENTRYPOINT as well as CMD.  You'd have to decide which
to use if they're both present.

[Something I notice experimenting is the lack of fabled fast startup
with docker with the installation I have.  It seems similar to vagrant
with virtualbox, which I normally use, but which isn't nearly trendy
enough.]
