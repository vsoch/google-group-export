Hi Vanessa,

I have bootstrapped a container from docker and have installed some more 
dependencies. Do not have a recipe file for it. Is it possible to copy a 
folder from the host into this already existing container? 
Would I need to create a recipe file for the container that includes 
building it in it's entirety or can I just use a cp command to copy the 
files and folders in an existing container?

Thanks!

Rutu

This isn&#39;t covered by %files or %setup, but what I like to do is to get=
 data that should go in the container from some nice version controlled pla=
ce, usually github :) This comes down to just cloning it (or wget, your cho=
ice) in the %post section:</div><div><br></div><blockquote class=3D"gmail_q=

lone https://...</blockquote><div><br></div><div>This way, you can throw yo=
ur recipe around, it can lose the folder it was in (with the dependencies o=
n the host) and still have a good chance of working unless the files hosted=
 on Github or elsewhere went away. It&#39;s also less burdensome to keep th=
e data / recipe packaged together. Of course it&#39;s understandable if the=
 files are too big for version control / download. but in this case I would=
 question if you want to add them to the container, period. Big data like t=
hat might arguably be better to be mounted at runtime.</div><div><br></div>=

 The derivation that you choose above is probably going to depend on your u=
