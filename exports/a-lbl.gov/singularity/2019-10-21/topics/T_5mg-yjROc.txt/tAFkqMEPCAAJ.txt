This is probably for Vanessa. Would you mind telling us what is the 
Singularity Hub's "Third-party application" name from the GitHub's 
standpoint, and, if possible, how to request access to the Singularity Hub 
application from GitHub?

The reason for this is that I created an organization inside of GitHub for 
our center so more people can contribute container definitions under one 
umbrella. By default the GitHub organization does not allow third party 
application access to the repos, so, I was not able to see them in 
Singularity Hub. After turning the restriction off, I can see them on 
Singularity Hub, but, that allows all third-party apps access which may not 
be desirable.

Thanks,
MC
