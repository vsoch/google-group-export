This is one one of the places that containers are not completely portable.
Any user space application that requires a specific kernel API will be
somewhat limited by necessity on what version(s) is/are installed within
the container. This is the same for OFED, and one of the reasons that
addressing this via a hybrid MPI model works so well.

That is a very interesting idea. Not sure how to implement, or how
practical the implementation would be, but I like the thought experiment!

When you say "drivers", you are referring to the library drivers, not the
kernel drivers, correct? If so, as you mentioned, this will really limit
the container portability and may result in very weird and unexpected
errors. Aside from publishing the versions of the Cuda libraries/drivers
you require (either in the container or on the host respectively), I'm not
sure the best way to handle this. It might be a very good question to open
up to the community or even to Nvidia themselves (and/or Intel with KNL).

Thanks!
