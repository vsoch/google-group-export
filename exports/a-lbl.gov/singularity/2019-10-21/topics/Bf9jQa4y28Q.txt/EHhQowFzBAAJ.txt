First of all, as a disclaimer, the performance of such an implementation of
all of the Hadoop services on a single host would most likely be abysmal.

That having been said, you can use an external reflector such as ngrok to
present your locally-hosted instances on external IP addressers. Once
again, you would want to give a lot of thought to doing this, as y0our
ngrok service would have to be very nearby your actual instances to make
this work.
