I don't think scanning containers with Clair really addresses the issue in the
thread of exploiting filesystem drivers - it's just checking for CVEs present in
any apt/yum packages installed inside the container. I think it's a useful thing
though.

The current status of this work is:

 * There's a working python CLI tool that will scan a Singularity image using Clair
   and spit out basic JSON/text information about identified issues:

   https://github.com/dctrud/clair-singularity

   It requires Clair to be spun-up under docker to do this (instructions in the
   README using some handy pre-populated docker hub images).


 * I'm currently thinking about integration with how we plan to use sregistry
   here at UTSW. We definitely want something like the quay.io security reports
   visible in our internal registry web interface. I know Vanessa is keen to
   keep sregistry as unencumbered as possible with extra stuff, so I'm thinking
   about the idea of a plugin-able Django app, and being able to setup periodic
   / on upload scanning through handled by celery jobs with that. It's
   definitely something we want to have here, so will happen - just not
   entirely sure when, as I'm committed to a lot of training and things in the
   next couple of months.
