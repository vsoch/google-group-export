Subject: 1.0 on it's way and R and X11 supported in containers now!
From: "Gregory M. Kurtzer" <gmku...@lbl.gov>
To: singularity <singu...@lbl.gov>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a114412842e9f4b052fae2f9e

Just a quick status update, I am in final testing for release. If there are
any other feature requests they won't make it into the 1.0 release, but any
failed testing and let me know ASAP!

With that said, one liner specfiles (Exec: $PROGRAM) now also working for
X11 applications (obviously this is limited to just X11 core requirements)
and the R statistical scripting language. Additionally we have already had
support for Perl, Python, other scripts, and MPI.

The 1.0 will be quite fully featured indeed! :D
