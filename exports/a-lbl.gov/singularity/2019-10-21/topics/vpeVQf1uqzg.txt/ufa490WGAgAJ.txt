@vroopchansingh I've tried to replicate this error, but I am not running
into the same problem as you. See the log here:
https://gist.github.com/chrisfilo/376a683381d762f2c8b15385947b9c64

Since some time ago I've added debug info (the "(2/9)" "(3/9)" etc.) we
know that the problem indeed happens when the exported tar file gets
imported to an empty Singularity image. I would suggest two things:

1) Could you see if the .tar created by docker expert is not corrupted?
2) Could you try running docker2singularity in a container like described
here: https://github.com/chrisfilo/docker2singularity/blob/master/README.md

This should narrow down the problems.

@vsoch I agree this is a bit confusing. I'm happy to consolidate, but I
think we should also have to move the main singularity repo (
https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity - which is currently held under
gmkurtzers username) to the singularityware organization (I assumed this is
what you meant by Singularity family).

There is also another layer of confusion caused by the fact that the
docker2singularity.sh script exists in singularityware/singularity-python
in two places /singularity/scripts/docker2singularity.sh
and /examples/docker2singularity/docker2singularity.sh

Best,
Chris
