I looked into this when you posted 4 days ago, and based on the build
relying on being from within a Docker container, and that Docker container
not having privileged, with the current implementation it would not serve
as a reasonable builder. I got very close, but at the end of the day always
ran into 400 (permission denied) issues. I would engage directly with
Github to see if they could provide a modified running environment. This is
important to look into because it really comes down to GitHub being able to
provide all of the functionalities / services that are currently afforded
by CircleCI, TravisCI, etc. This early development / beta phase also will
likely determine the container bases that are supported, and currently
Singularity isn't (natively) one of them.

Maybe in your container kitchen, put this one on more of a front left
burner? If you want the outcome of the soup to be better?
