Howdy all, just thought I would share some of the singularity awesomeness..=
 on a quiet day where production queues were loaded with work, I remembered=
 that I had some videos that needed encoding smiley so I created a singular=
ity image with Debian and setup all the ffmpeg libraries on it, coz it was =
was less work in Debian than CentOS 6(our hpc production cluster OS). So I =
had 10-12 nodes(~200 cores), available on our test Univa Grid Engine Queue,=
 threw Singularity on all the nodes, copied the input files to the Lustre F=
S, added to the %runscript '/usr/bin/ffmpeg "@#" , created a job script for=
 UGE, copied the singularity image to central nfs share, queued (qsub) the =
job file with ffmpeg parameters, job ran on a grid engine cluster, with Lus=
tre, IntelMPI, CentOS6.2 (2.6.353.. Kernel), and Viola! successfully encode=
d my data(videos).. smiley great use of my idle time as well as idle nodes =
smiley hehe.. I have also had success with creating a Bareos singularity im=
age in CentOS7, and creating init.d scripts on the host OS Centos6, so the =
Bareos singularity deamons were started using service start ... and service=
 stop ...etc,,, worked like a charm, because then I got to test the image i=
n different environments attached to different ATL's, tape drives and disk.=
. the portability that singularity brought with it was a real big time save=
r and just made the POC a lot easier, less painful, and cleaned up, as If i=
t was never there. .. Thank you Singularity!
