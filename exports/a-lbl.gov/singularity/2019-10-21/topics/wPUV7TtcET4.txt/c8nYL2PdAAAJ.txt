Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity and "development mode" python package
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hello,

Some more test.
When running the container with --contain it launches the software
installed in the container, and not the one in the host $HOME.
But none of the host $HOME is available. This is not desirable if
needed to run the software on host data, which is the likely use case.
It seems like the solution might be to create a virtualenv inside the conta=
iner.

Regards,
Laurent
