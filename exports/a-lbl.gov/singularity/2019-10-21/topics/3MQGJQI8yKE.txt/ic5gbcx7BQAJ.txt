I have a docker image that is hosted on Docker hub. I want to use that 
image with Singularity on my HPC. 
My docker image is meant to be run as an executable, and Docker gives me 
the option to pass a file with environment 
variables to the container at run time. When using docker I run ```docker 
run --env-file /path/to/env bind/path:/data imageName```.
Is there any equivalent for passing environment variables with singularity 
to my docker container at run time?
