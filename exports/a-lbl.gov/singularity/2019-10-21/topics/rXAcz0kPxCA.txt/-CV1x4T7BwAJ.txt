Hi Steven,

Thank you for pointing the confusing wording out! I will fix that.

It is intended to say that to use Open MPI in a hybrid manner (like this)
you must be using at least 2.1 (or maybe 2.0.1) as previous versions of
OMPI do not work.

Hope that helps and sorry for the confusion!

Greg
