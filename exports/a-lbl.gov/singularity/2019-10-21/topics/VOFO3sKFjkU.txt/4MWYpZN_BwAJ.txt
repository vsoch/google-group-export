Hi Remy,

I am not sure if this addresses your specific concern regarding Rscript,
but I have successfully packaged up Rscripts themselves (simply by adding
them to a Singularity specfile under %files or using the Exec keyword), as
well as packaged up Rscript specifically and embedded the path to the
Rscript.sapp into the interpreter line of an R script outside the
container. Both worked fine for me. Here is an example of the second
possibility:


[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ cat example.sspec
Name: Rscript
Exec: /usr/bin/Rscript


[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ singularity --quiet build example.sspec
Running test...
Hello from within the container... (no test code defined)
WROTE: Rscript.sapp


[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ cat rtest.r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript.sapp

sayHello <- function(){
   print('hello')
}

sayHello()


[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ PATH=3D.:$PATH
[gmk@centos7-x64 demo]$ ./rtest.r
[1] "hello"
