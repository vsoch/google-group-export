Hello Jean,

> -- why do we encrypt with the public key and give the private key to run 
the container? I was expected the invert 

This design is so that the public key can be shared freely without 
affecting who is able to decrypt a container. Anyone with the public key 
can encrypt a container which can then only be run on devices that securely 
hold the private key. Developers who have the private key can build 
encrypted containers freely without them needing to know the private key, 
so they couldn't get into other unrelated encrypted containers.

If we encrypted using the private key, and decrypted with a public key 
(that is designed to be shared with others) then only the holder of the 
private key can create containers encrypted with that key, but anyone who 
had the public key would be able to decrypt them.

> -- is the key only usable to run the container and cannot then be used to 
build a new sif out of this encrypted image?

A holder of the private key would be able to access data in the container, 
copy files out of it, derive things from it etc. The container must be 
decrypted (in memory) using the private key on a device in order to run it. 
There isn't a way here to allow people to run a container with the key, but 
prevent them extracting the files somehow. This is why the private key must 
be properly secured for only the devices / users that need it.
