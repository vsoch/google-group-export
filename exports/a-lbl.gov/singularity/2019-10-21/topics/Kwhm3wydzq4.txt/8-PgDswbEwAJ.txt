Thank you everyone that filled out the form!

I have one more request. I had to add one more field, node count (as there
is obviously no way to translate core counts to node numbers). For everyone
who has a registry entry filled out, can you please send me directly (and
privately) the node count of your entry(s) so I can update the entries.

Thank you!
