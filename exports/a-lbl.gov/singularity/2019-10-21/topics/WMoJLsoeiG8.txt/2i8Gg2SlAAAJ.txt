Hi all,

Thanks for the suggestions. Actually what I posted does work correctly, but
I think what killed scp file transfers were debug messages that I had added=
.

I was also interested in what Oliver was suggesting as we do use HTCondor,
but I had not considered starting remote interactive jobs. I do plan to add
something so that all HTCondor jobs run using the default image inline with
the Singularity login shell. So I will be following this closely.

Thanks,

Paul

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0To add on this: Another pos=
sibility you may consider, especially if you talk about a &quot;cluster&quo=
t;, is using something like HTCondor.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0With HTCondor&#39;s current=
 Singularity support, some bind-mount hacks, and an sshd installed inside t=
he container, this is already possible now (if Singularity is running setui=
d root).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; While it is possible (in theory), we have to b=
e very much aware of how we use our SetUID abilities, and we purposefully d=
rop all capabilities when we exec to a process within the container. The on=
ly way someone could actually run an ssh daemon inside the container is to =
run the container as root.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0We are already letting HTCondor run an sshd as user=
 inside our Singularity containers.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0So our users can run<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0condor_submit -interactive<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0on a desktop machine, and end up inside a Singulari=
ty container on a worker node.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0This naturally means privilege separation is disabl=
ed, and sshd can of course only let the single user in - but this is exactl=
y the way it&#39;s meant to be (in the HTCondor world) and the way HTCondor=
 is also using when running bare-metal.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The main issues why we still need SetUID-capabiliti=
es are related to the permissions, owners and groups on the devpts filesyst=
em in the container, which sshd is very picky about. In a user namespace, t=
here&#39;s no easy fix (apart from patching sshd).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0HTCondor takes care to set up such a temporary sshd=
 with one-time credentials for each user who wants to attach to an owned, r=
unning job. Sadly, it does that in a *separate* container to the original j=
ob right now, which is a bit useless,<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0but at least allows to run interactive jobs at all.=
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am going to ask Brian Bockelman to step in here, as he is our reside=
nt HTCondor expert.<br>
</span>Thanks! You may as well direct him to the thread on the HTCondor-use=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Then you can start an inter=
active job, and end up in a fresh container on the remote machine (as if ss=
h was used).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Behind the scenes, sshd is =
actually used - the nice thing is they have magic implemented to make that =
work<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0even if the cluster compute=
 nodes are behind a NAT in a private network (by using a connection broker =
machine).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0For file transfer, HTCondor=
 offers integrated techniques which are usually used for non-interactive jo=
bs.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0My hope is the HTCondor peo=
ple will at some point rework interactive jobs so the sshd can run outside =
the container and just use unprivileged nsenter to enter the container.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; You could do that but `nsenter` or rather the =
system call `setns()` implies a running container instance. With Singularit=
y, you don&#39;t need that, and you can just use the Singularity shell idea=
 I mentioned earlier, or the (very simple and clean) solution that Jeff men=
tioned. But... If you want to instead join an existing set of namespaces, S=
ingularity supports that with instances, however I&#39;m not sure a running=
 instance is required.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I can&#39;t use the Singularity shell idea for our =
setup without doing one of two things:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Grant the users SSH access to our worker nodes. I=
 don&#39;t want to do that - they are in a private network behind a NAT gat=
eway. The only access users get is via the reverse connections initiated by=
 HTCondor.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 This also ensures HTCondor is completely awa=
re of anything user-related running on those machines.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- Rewriting the logic of HTCondor. Currently, it al=
ways (no matter whether bare metal or container) fires up a dummy job in ca=
se an interactive job is requested (it just runs a &quot;sleep 180&quot; jo=
b).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 Then, the &quot;ssh-to-job&quot; approach is=
 used, as if one would attach to a &quot;real&quot; running job. The idea i=
s to enter the exact same environment of the job.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0For this, of course either nsenter or instances wou=
ld be fully working ideas. I suggested both on the HTCondor list a while ag=
o, sadly there&#39;s still no reply...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0But of course, I see many other applications in oth=
er environments for the Singularity shell, so I greet the idea ;-).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Gotcha, that makes perfect sense.<br>

</span>&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Then, we could also =
use that with user namespaces. For Singularity, this also requires <a href=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; We can use the user namespace, without SetUID,=
 now for this (if you are not using file based images). But you are right, =
Cedric&#39;s PR there is highly advantageous.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0With nsenter, there&#39;s a huge problem without Ce=
dric&#39;s PR in: When using nsenter to attach the container, you end up in=
 the same mount namespace, but with / being the root of the host.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0With Cedric&#39;s PR, this is resolved (due to the =
use of pivot_root).<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0That&#39;s why I would say that at least the &quot;=
nsenter&quot; approach requires this PR to be in to be useful.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Understood. Cedric&#39;s patch will be included as soon as possible, b=
ut not part of the 2.4.1 release which will be announced as alpha just in t=
ime for Supercomputing.<br>
</span>Understood, certainly, the patch is really important, but also rathe=
r large - so I totally understand review will take a bit ;-).<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0If you&#39;re not into sett=
ing up a workload management system such as HTCondor, related work includes=
 &quot;ch-ssh&quot; which is offered as part of Charliecloud.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0However, that&#39;s only fo=
r transparent ssh login, not file transfers.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Yes, ch-ssh may offer a similar functionally t=
o what I was describing (with a Singularity login shell), but I think that =
Jeff&#39;s idea is much cleaner.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&gt; Great ideas!<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Thanks!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Maybe another question, just since I did not test i=
t yet - do Singularity&#39;s instances work also when Singularity is not se=
tuid root?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Assuming you are referring to using the kernel user namespace, I have =
no tried it and Michael Bauer has been the primary devel on that project. I=
 don&#39;t see why it would not, but I must defer to Michael.<br>
</span>Thanks, I&#39;m looking forward to that - in our setup with containe=
rs on CVMFS, we don&#39;t need overlayfs, so user namespaces would certainl=
y be preferred (if HTCondor learns to handle them well).<br>
