[I've no idea what lengths IMPI might go to, but components from
different distributions may well not be compatible, and might not be
compatible with the kernel drivers.]

ibverbs isn't generally sufficient, even if you're not running whatever
Infiniband was called in the end.  You probably need an HCA-specific
component too -- libmlx4 in our case.

I thought the main idea of v2 was to get that right through packaging
(modulo optional packages, as above, and v2.0 doesn't support
bootstrapping with the multiple repos you likely need) as the old system
didn't work.
