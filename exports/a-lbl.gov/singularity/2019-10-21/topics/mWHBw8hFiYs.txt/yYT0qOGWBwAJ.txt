Hey Andrew,

You are doing great! Just a little bit more :)

I also took your advice and adjusted to create a new root folder (/opt
> seemed to be taken in my vagrant vm so used /duncanidaho)
>

I meant that you could install packages to a directory like opt (and you
would need to change permissions) and then at runtime, bind it somewhere to
your host:

 singularity run --bind /scratch/users/vsochat/julia:/opt/stuff
container.simg

If you plan to install more packages for the image *on* the cluster, and if
it's possible to do like R or Python and have a user owned package
directory in home, then you could use the container as a shell for the
primary julia, and install packages in your actual $HOME under ~/.julia
(which is mounted automatically too so you can write there). This isn't a
"share your image with a colleague and keep the same packages" but rather a
working image. When it's time to publish your work, then you can install
the final set to somewhere in the container (assuming writable isn't
needed) and share that.

Yeah sure thing!! :)
