Hi Dave,
  Have you had any success on kernel 4.18 FUSE w/o privileges?

I just tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2 w/kernel 4.18.0-17, and Docker 18.09.5=20
(latest from Docker repo, not ubuntu=E2=80=99s) and sshfs, but I get the sa=
me=20
"operation not permitted" error without --privileged or --cap-add...
I notice that /bin/fusermount is still setuid root, so perhaps that or=20
sshfs haven't been updated to use 'unprivileged mount' that's supposed to=
=20
be available in 4.18?

I will test again with libfuse3 and sshfs built from latest source, but=20
just checking.

regards,
Jason B.
