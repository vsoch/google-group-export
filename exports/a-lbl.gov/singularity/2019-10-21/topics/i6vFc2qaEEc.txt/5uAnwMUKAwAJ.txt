Heya Reid,

As you wish. LOL... The reason for having a Singularity specific format is
motivated by several reasons, some of which are:


* Resources: I've been spending the majority of my time and attention on
the backend container code. If there was a volunteer that wanted to help
specifically on bootstrapping, it would help a lot and I would be very open
to this! <hint hint>

* Features: The Singularity bootstrap definitions are specifically designed
for exactly what they are doing which simplifies integration and end user
simplicity.

* Ease of use: Again, being able to tune the features to specifically the
problem we are solving makes sense. for example, most of the work of
building a container seems to happen in the %post section, so that should
be a full featured shell scriptlet. The Dockerfile CMD keyword works great
for Docker containers because it can then build line by line incremental
layers, but that is not a feature we need in Singularity.


With that said... Yes I do have the intention to support the Dockerfile
format, but not within Singularity directly. This is because Singularity
would then have to replicate what Docker has already done (and done quite
well I would add) in a way that would be prone to error and always trying
to "keep up". This is not a good place to be... But on the other hand, if
Singularity were to leverage some of Docker's functionality directly,
Docker can be used to parse and compile the container and then hand it off
to Singularity. This in my mind is the right approach here, and I've been
building the code to easily support this.

Now all we need is some Docker experts to help out! I already have
volunteered Vanessa and Chris!.. Anyone else?
