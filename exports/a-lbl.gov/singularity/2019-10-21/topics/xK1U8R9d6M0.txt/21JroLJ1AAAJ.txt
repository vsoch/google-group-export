Subject: Re: [Singularity] Using bind with overlay to gain access to large
 directory tree
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hi David,

  I don't believe that will work... IIRC the overlyfs image is placed
on top of /. Then those other mounts are placed. So their permissions
(i.e. read-only) win since the overlay is already in place.

  Generally, we take file system permissions to restrict writing to
bound directories. Otherwise, in most use cases, they are actually
used for program output.

  If you look at "src/start.c" (I'm pretty sure this is the right
place, but others know the C code better than I do) you can see the
order that the mounts happen... So by default it goes:

    singularity_runtime_overlayfs();
    singularity_runtime_mounts();

  You could _try_ swapping singularity_runtime_overlayfs() and
singularity_runtime_mounts()... and see if that gets the expected
behavior you are after. But test on a junk directory...

  I was looking at 2.4.4 tag when going through this, and the above is
a guess on my part from scanning over the code here.

-J
