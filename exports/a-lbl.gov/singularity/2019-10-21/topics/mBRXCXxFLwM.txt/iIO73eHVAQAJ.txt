Hi all,

Having some troubles with fresh install of 2.5.1, built from source, on 
RHEL 7.4 cluster using LDAP (Bright Cluster).  Installing with software on 
shared filesystem, local state directory on each node, but is not operating 
on any. I had similar issues with 2.5.0, though it would simply segfault at 
the same point.

If run as root, I can execute containers.  If I execute as a user, I have 
two issues (one minor, one show-stopper) - listing both in the case they 
are related.  singularity.conf is completely default.

1) Home directory not owned by calling user: /  - If I specify --home 
$HOME, this isn't an issue. My /home mount is an NFS filesystem, but no 
symlinks involved.

Config file: https://pastebin.com/gnKgBc3C
Debug output: https://pastebin.com/w1gWytv1

2) Failed to obtain user identity information.   I'm not sure if this is 
tied to my use of LDAP for user information, but this one is stumping me. 
Again, this does not occur if run as root. (I have not tried with users 
that have been manually added to /etc/passwd, but I will try that 
shortly).   Singularity dies at step "singularity_file_passwd_create()".  
 Using v2.5.0, I disabled passwd creation in the config file, and that 
allowed execution to continue. Using 2.5.1, it dies whether the setting is 
on or off. (as if the option is being ignored)

Debug output:

Debug output with config option for passwd creation disabled:

Thanks for any insights.

Cheers,

Rob
