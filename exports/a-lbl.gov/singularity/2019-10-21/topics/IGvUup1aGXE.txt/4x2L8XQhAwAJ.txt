Many schedulers (PBS Pro, Grid Engine, for example) have APIs. You could
consider communicating with the API rather than trying to execute direct
commands, fool with libraries and details of the local implementation, etc.

This would be a good time to get work started on updating the old slurm
DRMAAv1 work to v2 (https://github.com/troeger/drmaav2-mock)!

Here is the one for PBS Pro:

https://github.com/PBSPro/DRMAAv2

And one for Univa=E2=80=99s Grid Engine:

https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2
