Hi folks,
I have written a pipeline that pulls together a series of different 
binaries. Given the large web of dependencies, I have created it in a 
singularity sandbox directory in a Ubuntu virtual box to deploy to the 
others who may want to use it. I have converted it to a squashfs image. 
Shell works fine in this virtual machine to access the singularity 
container and image. However when others download it and shell into it, 
there's no trace of anything that should be there (scripts, binaries etc). 
any ideas as to what might be going wrong?

Essentially, on my own virtual OS, the singularity sandbox directory works 
fine and has everything when I shell into it. When its transferred to other 
systems, theres nothing in it when I shell into it

Commands I have used are:

1) initial creation of container


sudo singularity build --sandbox pipleine/ docker://ubuntu

2) To shell into it and install dependencies etc:

sudo singularity shell --writable pipeline/

3) Create image:
singularity build new-squashfs pipeline
This image was then put on our local server and downloaded into other virtual box instances via sftp. When "sudo singularity shell new-squashfs" is used, the entire image is empty, there is no files.

Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong? I'm very 
unfamiliar with singularity, so I'm trying to get a handle on it!

Thank you

Graham
