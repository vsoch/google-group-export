Hi Martin,

 that's really nice to hear!

 I was surprised as well when I retested latest wine stable. Stability is 
much improved over what I experienced in 1.x versions. I can acknowledge a 
lot of (old) software works now much better. 
The one thing to consider seems to be to install some crucial native DLLs 
using winetricks which are still not bug-free and will render most software 
unstable. Sometime it can be annoying to figure out which DLLs these are.

I will check it.

I found that there are still some problems with this approach that 
reads/writes into container directories. I guess that some wine processes 
running in the background are not terminated reliably, and this can lead to 
broken containers which needs to be fsck-ed. And I'd like to find an 
approach to integrate well the licensed parts of the software I am creating 
within a container on singularity hub, ideally in a non-interactively 
scripted way. But this seems to be hard. 
I guess this will be especially important in case of win software since I 
guess these may be mostly non-open source.

Right now I hope to stabilize the current method further and fix the 
problems which may arise.

That'd be great if people could really use this approach instead of VMs. 
Let me know of the pros and cons you're experiencing there for your use 
case.
