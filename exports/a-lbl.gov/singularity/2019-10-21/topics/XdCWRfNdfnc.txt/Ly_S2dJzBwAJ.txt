The mac was for a developer, but your answer totally pointed out where my 
error was. For some reason when I read the documentation I thought I was 
supposed to have the singularity.conf *INSIDE* the container....Doh! That 
is why it wasn't working. I made the changes to my *system* 
singularity.conf, and it amazingly works. :-)

Yup. I got that much from the documentation.

THAT is a useful command to know! Gotta put that on my wall of commands to 
remember. :-)

Thank you VERY much for your help. I had tried different things for like an 
hour before I decided it was better to ask for help. I have learned a few 
things *and* solved my problem. Double win! :-)

Thanks! Have a great day!
