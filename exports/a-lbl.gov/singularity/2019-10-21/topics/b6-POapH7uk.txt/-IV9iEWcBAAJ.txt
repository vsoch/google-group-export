Hi Vanessa,
    The use-case i'm interested in at the moment is building OpenMPI 
against system specific Cray/Torque libraries. For technical and legal 
reasons i'd rather not copy all of the required proprietary files into the 
container and would prefer to just expose the directories through a bind 
mount. Right now i'm bootstrapping the container and then building OpenMPI 
through exec commands, this seems ok for now. I'm worried though that the 
issue of the bootstrap %post and %test environments not mirroring the 
"runtime" environment will cause further issues down the line in similar 
situations.

Thanks,
Adam
