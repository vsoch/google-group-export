<br>&gt; Hi,
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Concerning flatpak (<a href=3D"http://flatpak.org/" rel=3D"nofollo=
w" target=3D"_blank">http://flatpak.org/</a>), you wrote &quot;flatbak&quot=
;, and the
<br>&gt; pop-up does not work on the website actually.
<br>
<br>It&#39;s the future^Wpresent...
<br>
<br>&gt; Now, I think, there are other techs that could be compare in the f=
aq:
<br>&gt; - app-image: <a href=3D"http://appimage.org/" rel=3D"nofollow" tar=
get=3D"_blank">http://appimage.org/</a>
<br>&gt; - rkt: <a href=3D"https://coreos.com/rkt" rel=3D"nofollow" target=
=3D"_blank">https://coreos.com/rkt</a> (you can also report to rkt-vs-other=
s:
<br>&gt; <a href=3D"https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/rkt-vs-other-project=
s.html" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/la<w=
br>test/rkt-vs-other-projects.htm<wbr>l</a> )
<br>&gt; - orbital-app: <a href=3D"https://www.orbital-apps.com/blog/catego=
ry/orbital-apps-com" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://www.orbital=
-apps.com/b<wbr>log/category/orbital-apps-com</a>
<br>&gt; - runC: <a href=3D"https://runc.io/" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_b=
lank">https://runc.io/</a>
<br>&gt; - snappy: <a href=3D"https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/" rel=
=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://developer.ubuntu.com/e<wbr>n/snappy=
/</a>
<br>
<br>Yes, I&#39;d forgotten about some of the other things like that which m=
ight
<br>have been appropriate to mention.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know much about the=
m, but it
<br>seems from discussion I&#39;ve seen that flatpak is only for graphical
<br>applications, unlike snappy.
<br>
<br>There are clearly too many of these things...
<br>
<br>The crucial general point of comparison from my point of view is how th=
e
<br>processes are started, i.e. by privileged daemon access or as a normal
<br>process, potentially properly controlled by, say, an HPC resource
<br>manager.
<br>
<br>I&#39;d be inclined to write generally in terms of separate concerns:
<br>&quot;containing&quot; the necessary components required to run somethi=
ng
<br>c.f. maybe &quot;containing&quot; the behaviour of the processes when i=
t runs.
<br>
<br>&gt; Another question that could be added ? Can I run nested container =
within
<br>&gt; singularity ? (singularity in singularity or another container tec=
hs within
<br>&gt; singularity). It is used by lxd/lxc to run docker images as non-ro=
ot user.
<br>&gt; I think you can imagine some other use case.
<br>
<br>Right, related to the separation of concerns and how things compose.=C2=
=A0 As
<br>a simple example you could consider running singularity under, say,
<br>bubblewrap &lt;<a href=3D"https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap" =
rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://github.com/projectato<wbr>mic/bu=
bblewrap</a>&gt; (ignoring
<br>singularity --contain).
