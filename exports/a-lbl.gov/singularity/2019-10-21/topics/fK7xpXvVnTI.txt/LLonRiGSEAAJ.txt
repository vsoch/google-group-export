I believe /var would be most appropriate for the meat of the install and
functionality.
I can deff see a need for overriding some things, so I feel both answers
are correct.
Simply check for local user path   $HOME/.sapp-cache  and if found
override as a cascade
when applicable. Many other apps are successful following this style.

Cheers
Tim
