Howdy, container enthusiasts!

The Singularity 3.4.1 release has now been posted at: 
https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.4.1

This is the v3.4.1 bugfix release of Singularity, which addresses 
non-security related issues that were found in v3.4.0. We recommend you 
update to v3.4.1 for improved stability.


This point release addresses the following issues:

   - Fixes an issue where a PID namespace was always being used
   - Fixes compilation on non 64-bit architectures
   - Allows fakeroot builds for zypper, pacstrap, and debootstrap
   - Correctly detects seccomp on OpenSUSE
   - Honors GO_MODFLAGS properly in the mconfig generated makefile
   - Passes the Mac hostname to the VM in MacOS Singularity builds
   - Handles temporary EAGAIN failures when setting up loop devices on 
   recent kernels
   - Fixes excessive memory usage in singularity push
