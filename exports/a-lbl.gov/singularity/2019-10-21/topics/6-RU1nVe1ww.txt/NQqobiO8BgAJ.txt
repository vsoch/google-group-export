Hi,

You would also note that a singularity container is only one executable
file, limiting the needed number of read operations. Moreover, btw, there
is, by default, only the mount namespace + a chroot, contrary to others
container technologies where you will have additionnal layers and drivers
(eg: aufs, ...); overlayfs in singularity is optionnal.

You will be able to find some other tests/infos here:

https://www.cio.com/article/3269351/analytics/utilizing-containers-for-hpc-=
and-deep-learning-workloads.html

Kind regards,
R=C3=A9my.

If there is any docs on this, I&#39;d be happy to see through it. The reaso=
