Hey Guisy,

Sorry for the long turnaround on this. It should have been a simple problem
to solve but I had to contact a lot of people to figure out exactly where
the documents were and get access to them and make sure they were working
as expected.  There still seems to be a small hiccup with the Google form
where it wants to generate a link instead of giving you a submit button,
but if you generate the link and past it in the address bar you should get
the option to submit your answers.  We'll try to figure out why that isn't
working, but with the caveat it should be safe to use the link on the lbl
website to add your cluster to the registry now.  Thanks!

Dave
