??  It's not released for EPEL (and it's unfortunate that it got into
Fedora).  I need to consult on what to do about that.

As far as I remember, it requires flock, so won't work on a parallel
filesystem tuned to be fast.  (People may be saved by flock being
necessary for MPI-IO on Lustre, at least using ROMIO.)

The problems I've had with mounts/loopback in EL6 seem to be connected
with dbus interfering with loop devices in some way I've not figured
out.  Restarting dbus freed devices shown by losetup -a that were
apparently associated with dead processes.
