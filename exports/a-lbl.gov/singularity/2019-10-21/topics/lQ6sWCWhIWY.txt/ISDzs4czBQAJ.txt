Hi Greg and Ralph,

Thank you for your precise and elaborated answers.

Only for confirmation and to sum up some conclussions (if I understood
correctly):

 - OpenMPI process management compatibility depends on PMIx.
 - OpenMPI (and also Slurm) complete  backward/forward compatibility will
come (hopefully) in the future by means of PMIx 2.1.
 - Nowadays, there exists compatibility with OpenMPI 2.X if we compile it
with default PMIx (1.X) support.
 - OpenMPI 2.1 must be compiled with --disable-pmix-dstore due to a
compatibility break.
 - OpenMPI 1.X does not suppot PMIx and we can ignore it from this thread.

I'm right?

I'm interested in performing the tests you purpose. I will try to build all
three OMPI versions (2.0, 2.1 and 3.0) against the same PMIx external
library to check the compatibility. Which PMIx version (1.2.0, 1.2.1 or
1.2.2 ) do you recommend as a start point?

I will report this results ASAP to this thread.

On the other hand, although we are planning to add support to PMIx,
unfortunately, our Slurm version (14.11.10-Bull.1.0) does not support it
yet.

The second strategy we are testing to get compatibility between OpenMPI
inside and outside a Singularity container relies on replacing the OpenMPI
libraries inside the container by the host libraries hierarchy.

This approach rest upon the assumption that OpenMPI symbols and data
structures are compatible through several versions of OpenMPI. At least
combining several releases that share the same major version.

Although the empirical tests of this approach seem to work properly with
some tests, benchmarks and real apps, I'm afraid of getting unexepected
errors/warnings (segfaults, data errors, etc.) in the future.

What do you think about this approach?

Can you confirm that OpenMPI is compatible in this way?

Finally, I think this thread could be very interesting for other users too
and I would like to keep it alive with your help.

Thank you again for your support!

BR,
V=C3=ADctor

 Greg said, we have been concerned about this since we started looking at S=
ingularity support. Just for clarity, the version of PMI OMPI uses is PMIx =
(<a href=3D"https://pmix.github.io/pmix/" target=3D"_blank">https://pmix.gi=
thub.io/pmix/</a>)<wbr>. While our plan from the beginning was to support c=
ross-versions specifically to address this problem, we fell behind on its i=
mplementation due to priorities. We just committed the code to the PMIx rep=
o in the last week, and it won=E2=80=99t be released into production for a =
few months while we shake it down.</div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px"><br=
></div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px">I fear it will be impossible to get =
the OMPI 1.10 series to work with anything other than itself as it pre-date=
s PMIx.</div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style=3D"font-s=
ize:12.8px">The OMPI 2.0 and 2.1 series should work across each other as th=
ey both include PMIx 1.x. However, you probably will need to configure the =
2.1 series with --disable-pmix-dstore as there was an unintended compatibil=
ity break there (the shared memory store was added during the PMIx 1.x seri=
es and we didn=E2=80=99t catch the compatibility break it introduced).</div=
><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px">=
Looking into the future, OMPI 3.0 is about to be released. It includes PMIx=
 2.0, which isn=E2=80=99t backwards compatible at this time, and so it won=
=E2=80=99t cross-version with OMPI 2.x =E2=80=9Cout-of-the-box=E2=80=9D. We=
 haven=E2=80=99t tested this, but one thing you could try is to build all t=
hree OMPI versions against the same PMIx external library (you would probab=
ly have to experiment a bit with PMIx versions to see which works across th=
e different OMPI versions as the glue between the two also changed a bit). =
This will ensure that the shared memory store in PMIx is compatible across =
the versions, and things should work since OMPI doesn=E2=80=99t care how th=
e data is moved across the host-container boundary.</div><div style=3D"font=
-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px">As I said, we will =
be adding cross-version support to the PMIx release series soon, without ch=
anging the API, that will ensure support across all PMIx versions starting =
with v1.2. Thus, you could (once that happens) build OMPI 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0=
 against the new PMIx release (probably PMIx v2.1.0) and the resulting cont=
ainers would be future-proof as OMPI moves ahead. The RMs plan to follow th=
at path as well, so you should be in good shape once this is done if you pr=
efer to =E2=80=9Cdirect launch=E2=80=9D your containers (e.g., =E2=80=9Csru=
n ./mycontainer=E2=80=9D under SLURM).</div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px"=

 we sometimes get lost in the numbering schemes between OMPI and PMIx ourse=
lves. Feel free to contact me directly, or on the OMPI or PMIx mailing list=
s, if you have more questions or encounter problems. We definitely want to =
make this work.</div><div style=3D"font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style=
