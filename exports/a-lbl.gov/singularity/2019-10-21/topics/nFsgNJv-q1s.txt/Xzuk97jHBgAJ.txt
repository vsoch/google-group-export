Thanks Dave,

Thanks for all of the work you are doing to help maintain Singularity in
EPEL!

I=E2=80=99d like to follow up on this announcement.  As Dave mentioned, the=
 EPEL
version contains a significant amount of code (>1,000 lines if I=E2=80=99m =
correct)
that have not been reviewed or audited for security by the upstream
maintainer, (Sylabs).  As he also mentioned, the Singularity community is
prioritizing version 3.0 development over new development in the old 2.x
branch, and it was deemed not to be a responsible use of time to
significantly rework the portion of the code that bind mounts host system
directories for the 2.x branch.

That said, the overall idea behind these changes seems to be very good, and
Sylabs looks forward to collaborating with the EPEL maintainers to get this
work reviewed and integrated into upstream for version 3.0.

I bring this up because it means the current version of Singularity in
EPEL-testing should be considered a fork.  Sylabs cannot vouch for the
security of this release and cannot support it.  As Dave rightly mentioned,
any problems should be reported directly to him.  Hopefully, this situation
will be temporary, and the code bases will converge once again with the
release of version 3.0.

Please feel free to reply in this thread or on Slack if you have any
questions or comments.  Thanks!

Dave G
