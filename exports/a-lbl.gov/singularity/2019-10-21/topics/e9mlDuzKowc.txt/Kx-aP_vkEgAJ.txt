Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity within Docker: could not virtualize
 mount namespace
To: singularity@lbl.gov

Hi Chris,

Locally, we were able to get singularity-inside-Docker working by
adding the following to the Docker command line:

--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN

That gives the container more privilege for setuid apps, but
significantly less than adding --privileged.  The full list of default
caps is here:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/

If you drop the default caps, the other ones needed are:

DAC_OVERRIDE
SETUID
SETGID
SYS_CHROOT

That said, we still only allow this flag when the user is utilizing
sysadmin-provided images.  For user-provided docker images, we drop
all caps.

HTH,

Brian
