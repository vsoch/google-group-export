Subject: Re: [Singularity] Re: "cpio: cap_set_file" when building sandbox on NFS

Hi C=C3=A9dric,

Thanks for the explanation and that's exactly what I thought. The
reason why I wanted to raise it as an issue is,

1. The old "bootstrap" command is fine and doesn't generate an error.
Although I do lose the capabilities on ping but that's fine and I know
it and know how to fix it at a later time, which is not a big deal.
But "build" command failed really hard on this made me think it could
be somehow related to Singularity, or at least the differences between
"bootstrap" and "build" on NFS.

2. I don't think this is a plain cpio's fault as if you try to
manually extract files then they are fine (capabilities aside). But
the "build" command would extract a file with wrong filename which is
beyond me,

>> [root@nfs0 bin]# ls -l ping\;5a39b947
>> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 66176 Aug  4 01:01 ping;5a39b947

Note that little tail "\;5a39b947" was appended after the extraction.
This is the exact reason that caused the "build" process to fail I
think since "bootstrap" extracts the correct filename.

Thanks,
