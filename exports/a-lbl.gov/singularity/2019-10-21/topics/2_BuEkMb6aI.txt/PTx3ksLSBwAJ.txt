Subject: Re: [Singularity] how to obtain singularity cmdline from within container?

Oh that is a great idea! Can you create a GitHub issue/RFE for that, and I
will start considering how best to do that. It goes along with some of my
other ideas on a Singularity login shell (so users can login to any host
into an environment that they control). BTW, these are potential v2.4
features, yet we haven't even released 2.3 yet! lol

Thanks!
