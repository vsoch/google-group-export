Subject: Re: [Singularity] How to tell singularity to use a specific config file?

Hi,

Since it affects the security settings of the binary, one cannot allow
users to specify the configuration file.  It gets hardcoded at compile
time.

You *can* specify a NFS-mounted configuration file as part of
./configure step.  Did you try to 'make clean' after running
configure?
