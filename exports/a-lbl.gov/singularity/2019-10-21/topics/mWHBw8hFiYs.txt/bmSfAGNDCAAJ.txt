Great, this worked, thank you Vanessa! The key was modifying the 
permissions for the $JULIA_PKGDIR directory (chmod -R 777 /opt), but I 
didn't need to do any binding on the sherlock cluster side of things. Not 
sure if this will get me in trouble later, but for now I'm happy with this 
approach :)

I'll get my jobs running, hopefully this thread will be helpful to another 
julian looking to make packages work (note: Pkg2, v0.6.2, not Pkg3 soon to 
be renamed Pkg) and I'll try to get a working recipe on singularity hub 
sometime.

Thank you again!
Andrew
