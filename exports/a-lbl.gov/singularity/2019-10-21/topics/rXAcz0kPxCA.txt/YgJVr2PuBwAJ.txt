Hi Gregory,

 thanks for your responses!

I was mainly asking because of this statement:

Notes: 

Supported Open MPI Version(s): To achieve proper container'ized Open MPI 
support, you must use Open MPI version 2.1 which at the time of this 
writing has not been released yet. The above example builds from the 
current master development branch of Open MPI.  

given at http://singularity.lbl.gov/#hpc

We run a software stack with >10 different versions of MPI and thus it is 
important to us that containerized MPI apps are properly managed by Torque 
and can make use of the IB transport which is something docker was giving 
troubles when running unprivileged. Also, to me it is not fully clear 
whether MPI needs to be installed both in the container and on the host.

I will soon commit further experiments with MPI, thanks and bye
Steven
