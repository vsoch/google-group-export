Singularity doesn't virtualize CPUs; hence, the CPU on the outside and insi=
de are the same.

The KNL should "just work" as it is just a CPU.  The first-gen Phis might w=
ork out of the box, but since they are a coprocessor, they might require so=
me effort to make sure they are visible from the container.
