Hi Jason, 

many thanks for the detailed reply!

This was of course implied in my suggestion. It's clear to me an indication of -rc# is wanted. 
With CMake this could be a one-liner, for the autotools-dinosaur I am sadly not the expert. 

It's also harder and harder to find good examples of projects using autotools, most projects migrated away long ago
since young contributors usually start with more modern tooling such as cmake, waf / scons or meson,
and projects want to attract new contributors. 
So I sadly can't find a good example on how version handling is generally done with autotools on github.

That appears to be a reasonable way out, in case the version string generation can not be fixed to take prereleases / alphas / betas into account. 
It still feels wrong to humans (or, well, at least to me), 
since it's not clear from the version string alone that this is an rc for 2.4.6, and is very unlike other packages doing RCs. 
But most other projects leave the packaging to distro packagers anyways,
so it's probably fine to use something which "just works". 

For Debian, in case they package the RC, they have their own Debian changelog for Singularity in any case: 
http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/s/singularity-container/singularity-container_2.4.5-1_changelog
So for them, fixing up the version number violating packaging standards is not really an issue.

I think Singularity is the first package I encounter doing it this way - 
usually, an rc, or beta, or alpha, always contains the version number it's an rc, beta or alpha of,
just as was done in the first rc here: https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.4.6-rc1 . 
This seems to be the very common practice. I liked this approach - it was following the common convention,
easily human readable and understandable. 

But if the change to that unusual numbering is clearly stated in all release candidate announcements, it's should be fine.

This can indeed also be done e.g. with OpenBuildService (i.e. build from a git tag),
but it may not work with all automations - some people and tools may rely on the tarballs / zips generated as
part of the release announcements at: 
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/

So I think it's best to have the package versions for Debian / RPM building from those tarballs available - 
so it's good to see that's going to happen with the next RC :-). 

Thanks and cheers,
	Oliver
