I was wondering if you were using the -p/--pid option to run your container
in a new PID namespace.  Doesn't look like it.  If you were then when you
were inside the container if you used ps you would only see processes
running within the container.  And from outside you would only see the pid
of the parent process but none of the pids for the processes running inside
the container.

I thought that might explain your zombie process, but maybe not.
