To quote 90's band "The Offspring" IMHO "You gotta keep 'em separated"

Personally I think this is a larger question: How do we (as research
software engineers, or whatever you would like to call us today) catalog
and attach references (DOI's I guess) to larger data sets. Does it make
sense to mksquashfs or tar.bz2? What if they are already in a single hdf5
file? And what about the output data set? we obviously want that to land
outside the computational container, but how should we package the output
so it can be referenced directly? How do we make that whole thing
discoverable and encourage researchers to attach sufficient metadata to
make it searchable?

I'm wondering if part of the solution is some sort of "meta container" that
downloads a set of versioned data with specific checksums, and a versioned
tool container with a specific checksum, and attaches them in a
reproducible way.

To address Dominque's question directly: I'd keep the "semi-separated".
Whatever your researchers use for archiving/cataloging/managing their data
sets, keep that in place and add the singularity container to the data set
(rather than adding the data set to the singularity container).
