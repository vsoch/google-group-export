Hi Vanessa,

Thanks for your quick reply!  What I am most interested in is preventing 
files in the host system's user home directory from affecting the 
environment of the container shell.  As the most basic example: .bashrc:  I 
don't want the shell I spawn within my container to initialize with a 
configuration file that exists outside.

Another example.  One of the users at our lab insisted that his code simply 
would not run efficiently on our cluster, so he ended up shipping his data 
off site for years.  When I dug into his problem, I ultimately discovered 
that he had a dot file in his home directory that was enabling profiling in 
his code.  He had totally forgotten about the config file.  But this is the 
sort of problem that singularity could prevent by providing a consistent, 
self-contained, environment.  The issue is that a user's home directory 
mounted from outside the container introduces the possibility of all kinds 
of site-specific differences into the container.

I'm thinking a modification of the -H option to take solely the target part 
of a source:target pair:

  # singularity exec -H :/contained/home ...

This would simply set the user's home directory within the container to 
'/contained/home'.

Does that make sense?

Cheers,

Chris
