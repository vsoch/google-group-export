Hi Dave 

Thanks for your response

I wasn't quite sure where the  #!/bin/sh declaration you were refering too 
was as I hadn't specifically declared that in the %runscript section.

I investigate a little bit more with the following recipie, this time 
explicitly declaring that I want this to execute in bash as per your 
suggestion.

BootStrap: docker
From: jncc/arcsi-base

%runscript
    #!/bin/bash
    echo The shell is $SHELL
    unalias source
    unset -f source 
    source --help
    source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base

So rather then use the . notation I explicitly called the bash source 
command. As far as I'm aware this is inbuilt so I would expect it to work. 
The unalias and unset were just incase some definition was overriding 
source.

I built a container called arcsi-base.img and ran it. The output from the 
first few commands is interesting and inexplicable.

If I run fully contained:

ubuntu:~$ singularity run -C arcsi-base.img
The shell is
unalias: source not found
/.singularity.d/runscript: 7: /.singularity.d/runscript: source: not found
/.singularity.d/runscript: 8: /.singularity.d/runscript: source: not found
..

So in this case it's unclear what the shell i'm running is and source is 
not found, that is if I just run source --help it tells me it cant find the 
command. So maybe it's not the bash shell.

If i run with a clear environment (-c) 

I get the following:

ubuntu:~$ singularity run -c arcsi-base.img
The shell is /bin/bash
unalias: source not found
/.singularity.d/runscript: 7: /.singularity.d/runscript: source: not found
/.singularity.d/runscript: 8: /.singularity.d/runscript: source: not found

This time the shell reports that its' bash but the source command is still 
not found? This really puzzles me.

If i run it with no command line options at all I get the same response:

ubuntu :~$ singularity run arcsi-base.img
The shell is /bin/bash
unalias: source not found
/.singularity.d/runscript: 7: /.singularity.d/runscript: source: not found
/.singularity.d/runscript: 8: /.singularity.d/runscript: source: not found

I've tried this on a basic ubuntu machien and also in a HPC environment 
with exactly the same results, so the issue definatly derives from the 
container. 

(The ubuntu box is running Singularity 2.5.2-dist.

Cheers
Felix
