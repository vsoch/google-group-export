"This is a Go API based on an open standard (Open Grid Forum DRMAA2) in
order to submit and supervise workloads like OS processes, containers,
PODs, tasks from a common interface.

It allows to develop and run job workflows in OS processes, and later
easily switch to containers running as Cloud Foundry tasks, Docker
containers, Grid Engine jobs, etc...

Its main pupose is supporting application developers with an abstraction
layer on top of platforms, workload managers, and cluster schedulers, so
that they don't require to deal with the underlaying details and
differences when only simple operations (like starting a container and
waiting until it is finished) are required.
It can be easily integrated in applications which create and execute job
workflows."
