Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity - Accessing files created through
 building of container

In the 2.3 development branch there are additions to the bootstrap
definition file sections:

%files: a list of files to copy from source to destination
%environment: any envars or shell "stuff" you want to happen on container
invocation (note: use Bourne syntax here, not Bash!)
%labels: space delimitated list of labels to assign to the container (this
is mostly used internally)

So using the below example, I would now do:

%files
myfile /opt/libs/myfile

%environment
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/libs
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
