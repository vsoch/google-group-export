Hi Vanessa,

That's certainly an approach I could take.  I tried to install in an old 
container (from v2.2) w/o starting from scratch.  From your response, I am 
guessing that there is NO command to calculate actual size of contents 
within an image?  I could of course, export it and calculate the size but 
that's circuitous.

Thanks,

-Vijay
