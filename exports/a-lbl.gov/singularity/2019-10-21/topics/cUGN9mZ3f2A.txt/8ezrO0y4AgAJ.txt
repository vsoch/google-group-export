If I recall correctly, it was possible at one point to import a Docker 
container into Singularity. But I believe you needed to still have an empty 
image to copy into. Otherwise, if you want to have a script which generates 
different image types, the script (which should know what programs to 
import into it) could easily just output the different recipe files for the 
image types. Because that's essentially what you'd want anyway, right? 
Unless you mean a physically intermediate image. In that case, I'd go with 
Docker and just import into Singularity. (All of these solutions are kinda 
spendy time-wise).
