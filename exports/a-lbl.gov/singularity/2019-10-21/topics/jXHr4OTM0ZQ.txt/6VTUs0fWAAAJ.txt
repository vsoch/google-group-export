The admin granting sudo just need to be aware that 
"sudo singularity" == "sudo bash" in terms of privileges on the running
host, not much different that giving allowing users to "sudo docker ..."

Building host: user's laptop or computer where he/she is root.
Running hosts: no sudo singularity, except for the usual admins.

ymmv

cheers
