Hey Lars and Bennet,

In the open source realm only the latest version of Singularity is
supported.  That's the way it's been for a long time.  Now that 3.0 has
been released, this means that the 2.x series will no longer be maintained
in open source.  If you still need to maintain an older version of
Singularity you should look into SingularityPRO.

https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/download/

That's exactly what SingularityPRO is.  LTS for previous releases of
Singularity.  (Plus streamlined security patches, user support, access to
cloud offerings, etc.)

Please let me know if you have any more questions or comments.  Thanks!

Dave
