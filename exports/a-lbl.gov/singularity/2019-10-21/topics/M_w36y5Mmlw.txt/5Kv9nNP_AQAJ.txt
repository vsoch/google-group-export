I think this is a fantastic idea! I'd happily not work on it if you were
interested.

Can you make it another content page? We can make it as big as we like then
and directly referable from the FAQs.

I will work on this one. I can add an FAQ as well as extend on the HPC page
that already exists and link between them.

BTW, there is the ability to use different MPI versions inside and outside
the container provided that the MPI outside (on the host) is newer or equal
to what is in the container. Additionally (as I understand it) it will
be theoretically possible to run different MPI implementations over PMIx. I
will add this to the info on the site.

Thanks again!!
