Hello everybody

So I've sort of solved this problem but if anyone else can shed a little 
more light on it, I'd be most obliged :)

It appears to be something to do with nvidia-uvm and a couple of processes. 
I ran a little experiment.

I rebooted my machine and ran lsmod and ps -ef, recording each. I then ran 
the CUDA Clock example and ran the commands again. I noticed that 
nvidia-uvm had been loaded and also two processes:

    251 root      2381     2  0 15:19 ?        00:00:00 [UVM global queu]
    252 root      2383     2  0 15:19 ?        00:00:00 [UVM Tools Event]

I then ran my singularity container and boom! Works first time! I get a 
NUMA information post:

I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:925] successful NUMA 
node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least 
one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero
I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:951] Found device 0 with 
properties: 
name: GeForce GTX 960
major: 5 minor: 2 memoryClockRate (GHz) 1.1775

But it appears to work. 

So I'm not sure what really was going on. Perhaps I need to mount the 
modules directory so whatever userspace process embedded in Tensorflow or 
CUDA can load this module and fire up the processes.

Anyways, it does seem to work. Hopefully this will help a few folks :)
Cheers
B
