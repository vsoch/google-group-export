One point is that the licence is LBNL-specific with the names
incorporated, and I'm not sure how that should be treated.  Presumably
there are Labs rules/policy on all this, but I've never run into them.

I know you're not a beginner, and maybe Warewulf experience is
different, but I think it's worth tracking copyright holders.  I try to
remember to add "Copyright <date> <holder> ..." for significant
contributions as well as noting them in log messages and noting when
they become significant.  For instance, I originally gave up on
packaging for Debian because the ftpmaster insisted on a complete list
of copyright holders, which wasn't available (as for Linux, amongst many
other packages, but...).  I've also had to re-write stuff whose
provenance wasn't available from revision history.
