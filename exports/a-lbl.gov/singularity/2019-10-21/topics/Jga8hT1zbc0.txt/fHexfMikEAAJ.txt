If you absolutely must used a gzipped tarball and don't want to use the 
native squashfs image, you can open the tarball with singularity natively 
without uncompressing it. Singularity will decompress it automatically, 
however you'll suffer a time penalty for this so I wouldn't use it for a 
production image. This can be useful when moving sandboxes between nodes 
during development.
