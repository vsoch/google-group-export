It might be useful to talk about how we can move toward something for the
first three (DistType, MirrorURL, and OSVersion) that look something like
FROM. For example, if it is the case that we have:

1) a set of base definition files (for fedora, debian, etc), that use these
commands, and
2) a singularityware/images repo,

we would want (akin to Docker) images to be able to bootstrap children of
base images. For example, by default the FROM command could assume pulling
a Singularity file from an image (corresponding to a folder name in the
repo), which likely would be extending one of the base debian/fedora
images. We would then provide additional (optional) tags in the file if the
user would want to use a different Singularityfile repository. For
example,a base OS would still look like this:

*singularityware/images:*

*        debian/jessie:*

*               Singularityfile*

                 DistType "debian"
                 MirrorURL "http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/"
                 OSVersion "jessie"

                Setup
                Bootstrap

                InstallPkgs vim

                Cleanup


but then I could use that image for my Singularityfile:


      *vanessa/pizza:*

*               Singularityfile*

                 FROM debian/jessie




and if I stored it in my own repo, I could add an additional variable like:



      *vanessa/pizza:*

*               Singularityfile*

                 FROM debian/jessie
                 REPO https://github.com/vsoch/pizza-images




Best,

Vanessa
