Hi Vanessa,

thanks for the quick reply. The example showed the tcsh syntax in runscript 
on purpose to show that AFAIK there's no way to force other shell than 
/bin/sh to interpret the %runscript section.

Though now I am not sure if there's a major need to change that since I can 
do something like
sudo singularity exec -w sed -i -e 's/bin\/sh/bin\/bash/g' 
/.singularity.d/runscript
to change the runscript shell interpreter to whatever I want.

And, I figured out the source of the question - using shell function in 
/bin/sh vs. bash.

I used one of the possible bash syntaxes, i.e.
function myfn()
{
something
}

which the /bin/sh did not like. Changing this to:
myfn()
{
something
}

Fixed that problem.

Thanks,
MC
