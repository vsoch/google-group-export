the C could be compiled as a static executable with no deps. I have no clue
about executable formats, but the data (the actual sapp) would have to be
embedded in the executable, similarly at what is done for compressed files
that are executable and self-uncompressable.

Some docker images could not be RPM or DEB compatible (minimal images,
alpine OS ,etc...), but you're right, for my use case it should work just
fine. I'll try it.
