Good afternoon,

In my build script, I am trying to add some files to a directory that is 
created after installing a package. The path to the file I want to 
overwrite is not present before the package is installed, so copying the 
file there in the %setup or the %files section doesn't work. Is there any 
way to e.g. execute %files after %post so the file copies to that location 
after the package directory is created?

The example: I want to include a default IPython configuration file in my 
container. During %post, i do:

%post
    # yatta yatta, install a bunch of packages
    export IPYTHONDIR=/mydir
    ipython profile create default # this creates a directory structure 
under $IPYTHONDIR/profile_default (i.e., /mydir/profile_default)

i want to then move a local file I have with the build script to that 
ipython directory. my %files section looks like this:

%files
    ipython_config.py $IPYTHONDIR/profile_default/ipython_config.py

However, that destination does not exist until after %post. Any thoughts?
