I also had an idea on how to do this.  I still think its possible, but have 
given up and gone the Ancible/build from scratch method.  Ultimately, you 
might want to consider doing this too.  It forces you to really examine 
what you are using for your work versus just grabbing everything and the 
kitchen sink :)

The approach I was considering was to use CDE (
http://www.pgbovine.net/cde.html).  This is a great idea and was designed 
to make portable apps.  You run your program and it "watches" every file 
you access.  It then copies each one (smartly) over to a pseudo-root 
directory.  At that point you could diverge.  CDE allows you to run within 
that pseudoroot, but instead you can just take those files.  I think this 
would be a fair amount of manual work.  But I do believe it has the 
potential to work.

Still I do think you are better off starting from scratch.  Potentially 
build you system from scratch on a virtual machine, then port that to a 
Singularity recipe.
