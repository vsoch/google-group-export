Thanks a lot for that clarification, Dave, that sounds great.

I was going to ask that someone update the security policy with this
info if needed, but re-reading point 8 again it already says "the
patches will be merged from the private development space into the
public repository" and does not limit that to only the latest version,
so the policy may already cover this.  It also says "a release will
immediately be made", although it doesn't define what release means if a
vulnerability only applies to older versions.  Maybe that would be good
to clarify.

Dave
