Hi Dave,

Thank you for your reply, and I can confirm this (missing import 
functionality) was/is indeed the source of my issues.

I went back and forth between your fork of Singularity and the "official" 
one (i.e. the one linked from LBL's Singularity web page).  The code I 
initially pulled from the repository linked from the LBL page does not have 
import functionality, despite the help messages and accompanying 
documentation indicating it does.  One I switched the code base to your 
fork and reinstalled, everything seems to work as expected.

I was able to import Docker container tar files produced both by Docker 
1.9.1 and 1.12.0, and those Singularity instances ran fine.

If there's anything else I should check or verify, or if you (or anyone 
else here) needs any more debugging information or test results, I can try 
to provide those.

Thanks again so much everyone!
