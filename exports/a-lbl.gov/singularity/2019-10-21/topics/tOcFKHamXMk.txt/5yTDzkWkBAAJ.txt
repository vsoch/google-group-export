Great! Thanks Rick,

I did create empty directory inside my image at the following locations:

/oasis/scratch
/oasis/tscc/scratch
/oasis/projects/nsf

I saw these as the mount points in the cluster /etc/fstab

Now I still can not see the mounted storage inside my image
/oasis/tscc/scratch appears as an empty directory in the image,
nothing is mounted there

I saw on my local machine, that singularity version 2.1  has 3
configuration files
located at /usr/local/etc/singularity (on my local machine),
among them this file:

singularity.conf

has the following section:

# BIND PATH: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: Undefined
# Define a list of files/directories that should be made available from
within
# the container. The file or directory must exist within the container on
# which to attach to. you can specify a different source and destination
# path (respectively) with a comma; otherwise source and dest are the same.
#bind path =3D /etc/singularity/default-nsswitch.conf, /etc/nsswitch.conf
bind path =3D /etc/resolv.conf
bind path =3D /etc/hosts
bind path =3D /dev
bind path =3D /tmp
bind path =3D /var/tmp
bind path =3D /home


But on TSCC,  singularity is version 2.0 and only has 2 configurations
files,
and does not have singularity.conf

Do we need this configuration file on TSCC?
And should we have a line in it that specifies that:

/oasis/scratch
/oasis/tscc/scratch
/oasis/projects/nsf

should be made available inside singularity images?

Thanks a lot!
