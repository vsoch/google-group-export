Hi Greg,

Interesting. I see why this is useful, but I'm wondering if this is not
breaking the isolation concept of containers hence reproducibility? I mean,
by using this approach what guarantees that the CUDA libraries provided by
underlying system will match with a specific version/implementation on
which a containerised may depend? This may not potentially break the
application portability?


Cheers,
Paolo (italian, not brazilian ;))
