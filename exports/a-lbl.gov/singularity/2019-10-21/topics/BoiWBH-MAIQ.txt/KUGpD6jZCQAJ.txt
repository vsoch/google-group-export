Thanks Ron,
That does sound similar. I'm a bit confused about how the dbus
communication plays a part between Xvnc and the Xserver (I can totally buy
that for the window manger attempting to attach to the dbus but the vnc
server?) Anyway things for the tip, I'll google in that direction :-)


Related question: Would would be the security implications of taking
directories defined in the global singularity.conf and mounting from the
host namespace to the container namespace without the MS_NOSUID option? I'm
still interested in making my other use case work (singularity in
singularity without sudo)

Cheers,

Chris.
