I too have been keeping an eye on the OCI, but I'm not sure how well the
format translates into Singularity concepts.

The runtime specification is based on a JSON file that defines various bits
about how the container should run (e.g. cores, memory, network ports,
user, as well as environment, entrypoint/command, etc..). In Singularity,
the first bits are not relevant and the latter Singularity currently
handles differently. With that said, there is no reason why Singularity
can't be extended to include the JSON file (if it exists).

As far as the packaging of the image (serialization), that also is very
different in that (as I understand it), OCI builds images based on layers
of tarball diffs. While in theory, this too should be able to be leveraged,
but it doesn't strictly apply to the current Singularity model. I have
plans to support a URI which can possibly be used for this as well a
workflow or container ID in the Singularity-Hub.

I love the ideas, and if you see this clearer then I do, or if I'm wrong
about my understanding of the OCI, please let me know. :)

Thank you!
