Hey Stefan,

I think talking about these different questions is a really good thing to
do, and would be helpful to add for others to our various documentation
places. I've created a google doc that should be writable to all in the
list with the link with your questions:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Le4rr9pI24ner7sWVGsgk0puHJN9uysvmE5jhC5CZ1g/edit?usp=sharing

Per your suggestion, please everyone contribute questions, answers,
comments, all of it! We can put together a good draft of something that we
like and it will be very helpful for others to learn. Thanks Stefan!

Best,

Vanessa
