So, here is the vagrant script I use to build the vm that hosts singularity 
on my laptop:
```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"
$script = <<SCRIPT
SINGULARITY_VERSION=2.4
FILE=/usr/local/bin/singularity
if [ ! -f $FILE ]; then
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y squashfs-tools
sudo apt-get install -y  gcc build-essential python
wget 
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/download/$SINGULARITY_VERSION/singularity-$SINGULARITY_VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf singularity-$SINGULARITY_VERSION.tar.gz
cd singularity-$SINGULARITY_VERSION
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
sudo make
sudo make install
fi
SCRIPT
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.provision 'second',  type:'shell', inline: $script, 
preserve_order:true
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "2048"]
  end
end
```
From what I gather, the base box (trusty) does not have singularity 
pre-installed, and the install of singularity from git seems pretty vanilla 
to me. 
I've destroyed the box and rebuilt it and I still get the same persistence 
in changes as described above...
