Hi tin h,

Thanks for taking the time to help. I don't think the container is full due 
to the tools. I was able to build is successfully without it running out of 
space using bootstrap. But yes I definitely ran into this issue in the 
beginning.

However as you can see by running df -h in the container, there isn't a 
space issue:

Singularity cipher.img:~> df -h
Filesystem                      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
OverlayFS                       1.0M     0  1.0M   0% /
