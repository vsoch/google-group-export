Hi Chris,

If you have important files for the runtime of the container, for the sake
of reproducibility I would caution you from keeping these in home. If
another user were to use your container, would it be broken?

For files and dependencies in your home that are shareable, I would save
them somewhere more reliably present in the image (/usr/local/app or
/opt/app).  If you want to be saving some home with "secret" settings then
I think having it mount is the right way to go. You would want to provide
clear instruction to other users about the needed secrets, lest they run
the container without them.

If you want to define some custom home, then take a look at the --home/-H
option provided in most commands (shell, exec, etc.) it should let you
specify a custom path (other than /home/[username]) for home when you run
the image. This is however, a bind, which doesn't seem to be what you want?
If you want to specify another directory in the container "as the actual
home" I take it you mean something in the container *not* bound, in which
case see my concern above.

If these ideas aren't resolution to your issue, if you could provide more
detail we can think of some workaround that is both portable and
satisfactory.

Best,

Vanessa
