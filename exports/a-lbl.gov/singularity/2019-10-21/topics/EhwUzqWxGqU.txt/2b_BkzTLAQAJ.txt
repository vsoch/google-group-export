Hi Gregory,
We use proot to pretend that a user is installing the software in its final 
location. So no paths should be broken once a cron job really moves it into 
the final location.
So you think it would suffice to do 
chmod 4755 $libexecdir/singularity/sexec
to fix the problem?
Another peculiarity, which is probably typical for many HPC centers: the 
software is installed on a central file system that is mounted to the 
computing nodes, not on each node. Is that OK with singularity?
Considering that singularity image is several gigabytes, might it be too 
much of a burden on the network and file system to get it from a central 
file system on all the nodes?
Thank you,
Igor
