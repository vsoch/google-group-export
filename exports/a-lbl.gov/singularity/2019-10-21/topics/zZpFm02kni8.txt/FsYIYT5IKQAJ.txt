Hi Thomas,

I totally understand, I'm a biologist by degree! lol

The runscript and the Exec are technically mutually exclusive as they both
define what happens when the container is executed. I see a few problems
with your specfile:

1. It seems as though you are trying to package files from your home
directory. The problem with that, is that it will land in your home
directory within the container.... And that is a problem because when
Singularity binds your real home directory to the container, those files
will be over mounted (e.g. replaced with the contents of your real home
directory. This means that it *might* work for you on that host, but it
might not work on other hosts.
2. %runscript usage isn't correct. Specify the %runscript with no
arguments, and then the following lines will be used for the runscript
until either end of file is reached or another section name (e.g. %files).

If I can make a suggestion... This type of situation has been raised with
me in another email thread (I think it might have been private, but I'm a
bit lost in email right now) and it was one of the motivators for adopting
a more "typical" container build and management paradigm which you will see
in Singularity version 2.x. I am going to be branching 2.x very soon, are
you open to testing it?

Thanks!
