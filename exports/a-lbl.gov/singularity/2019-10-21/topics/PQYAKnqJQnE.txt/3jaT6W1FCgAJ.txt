Hi everyone,

Singularity release candidate 3.4.2-rc.1 is now available here: 
https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.4.2-rc.1

This is the first release candidate for the upcoming v3.4.2 bugfix release 
of Singularity, which addresses non-security related issues that were found 
in v3.4.1.

This release addresses the following issues:

   - Sets workable permissions on OCI -> sandbox rootless builds
   - Fallback correctly to user namespace for non setuid installation
   - Correctly handle the starter-suid binary for non-root installs
   - Creates CACHEDIR if it doesn't exist
   - Set apex loglevel for umoci to match singularity loglevel

If you are able to test this release candidate please do, and let us know 
about any issues you find. Community testing with as many workflows on as 
many platforms as possible will help us to deliver a great 3.4.2 release.

As always, please report any bugs to: 
https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/new

If you think that you've discovered a security vulnerability please report 
it to: secu...@sylabs.io

Thanks to our contributors 
<https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/graphs/contributors> for code, 
feedback and, testing efforts!

Have fun!
