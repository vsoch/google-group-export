Hi All,
How does Singularity handle the peculiarities of CPU? For example, when 
compiling on bare hardware, it is better to compile on the CPU you plan to 
run. Intel Broadwell has twice larger vector size than its predecessors and 
as a result we sometimes observed almost twice better performance for some 
code recompiled on Broadwell. If one plans to run on Broadwell and in 
addition to OS rpms needs to compile some user code inside the container, 
is it better to have separate containers optimized for different CPUs? I 
would think that inside the Singularity CPU is seen exactly as on the host 
and all the features would work?
Does Singularity work with Intel Phi (1st & 2nd generation)?
Thank you,
Igor
