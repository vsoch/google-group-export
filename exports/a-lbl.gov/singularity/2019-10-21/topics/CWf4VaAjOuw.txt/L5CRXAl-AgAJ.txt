Folks,

I have a fundamental question on how the Singularity containers work with 
respect to OS kernel settings.

Say for example the container was "built" on a system with RHEL kernel 
which had certain kernel settings disabled (e.g. Transparent Huge Pages ,  
cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled --> never)

Now when this container is "run" on a system with Host OS which has those 
kernel settings enabled (e.g. Transparent Huge Pages,  cat 
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled --> always)

Will the container use the Host OS kernel settings on where it is run or 
the OS settings it was "built" on? If latter is it possible to enforce the 
container to use the Host OS kernel setting on where it is run?

Thank you!
