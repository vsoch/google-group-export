Hi singularity group, 

Did anybody face the same problem before. As I understand in 2.4 there is 
no reason to define the container size. What would cause that problem then? 

To give more context, I was able to generate a container using the sandbox 
option and convert it back to simg. However I would like to generate the 
simg directly.

Thanks,
George.
