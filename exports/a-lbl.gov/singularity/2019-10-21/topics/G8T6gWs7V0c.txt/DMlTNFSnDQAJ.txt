Yes, maybe I should explain this unnerving setup of mine a little more! 
This containerised hub will be running on a particular node of a HPC 
cluster. This node will host not only the hub but various other servers 
(e.g. a Shiny Server), all using SSL and exposed only to the internal 
network, which will be accessed by cluster users. 

Containers seemed like a good idea to isolate these servers which each come 
with their jungle of dependencies. The hub will have access to a shared 
folder to write and edit the notebooks (one subfolder per whitelisted 
user). 

In this context, PAM authentication seemed the way to go. It is both simple 
and would allow users to enter their UNIX credentials to authenticate on 
these servers and transparently edit the notebooks "as themselves" on the 
shared network storage space (which is bound to the container at runtime). 
I never used OAuth, but there would need to be a way to map OAuthenticator 
users (e.g. GitHub usernames) to HPC users, which is likely to also require 
some binding of sensitive files to make the container aware of them. In any 
case, because the users should be able to do file operations through the 
container "as themselves", I think some kind of user mapping to the host is 
unavoidable.

But given your replies, I am starting to wonder whether containerising the 
hub and these other servers may be more dangerous than simply running them 
as root outside of a container.  On the other hand, in both cases sensitive 
files are writable only by root and readable by the same users inside as 
outside the container.

I think you are referring to the documentation for the jupyterhub docker 
image (https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart-docker.html). 
I am not using that, but another one that I built using a dockerfile, then 
registered locally (and confusingly has the same name). It is a bit more 
complex than the default image, which, you are right, is mostly used for 
testing.
