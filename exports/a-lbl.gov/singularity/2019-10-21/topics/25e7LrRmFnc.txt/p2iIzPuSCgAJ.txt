Remy&#39;s not right about the warning; in your case, it is indeed<br>
/etc/localtime causing the warning, not --nv.=C2=A0 That&#39;s just another=
 case<br>
that can cause the warning.<br>
<br>
The problem is that in order for underlay to add a bind mount point<br>
inside a big directory such as /etc, it has to also bind mount every<br>

You can avoid the warning by including an /etc/localtime bind mount<br>
