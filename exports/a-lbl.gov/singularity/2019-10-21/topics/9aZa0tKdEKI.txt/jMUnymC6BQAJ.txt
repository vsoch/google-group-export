&gt; <br>
&gt; Are these paths visible from within the container? <br>

&gt; libcudart.so.7.5 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hi <br>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to help my user who is getting this message: <br>
&gt; probtrackx2_gpu: error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.so.7.=
5: <br>
&gt; cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory... <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; She created a singularity container by pulling a Dockerfile, which I c=
ould <br>
&gt; attach if needed <br>
&gt; In this Dockerfile it calls the cuda4singularity code. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; She submits it as a PBS job including &quot;module load cuda75&quot; w=
hich sets the <br>
&gt; library path to: <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; /cm/shared/apps/cuda75/toolkit<wbr>/7.5.18/extras/CUPTI/lib64:/cm<wbr>=
/local/apps/cuda/libs/current/<wbr>lib64:/cm/shared/apps/cuda75/t<wbr>oolki=
t/7.5.18/lib64
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And so; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; find /cm/shared/apps/cuda75 -name libcudart.so.7.5 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; /cm/shared/apps/cuda75/toolkit<wbr>/7.5.18/lib64/libcudart.so.7.5 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; /cm/shared/apps/cuda75/toolkit<wbr>/7.5.18/lib/libcudart.so.7.5 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks in advance for help <br>
