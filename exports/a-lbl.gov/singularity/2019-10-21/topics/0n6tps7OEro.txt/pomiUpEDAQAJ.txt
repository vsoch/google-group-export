So that seems perfectly reasonable to me. Indeed I was able to achieve
similar functionality by bind mounting OpenMPI from my CentOS host into my
Ubuntu container (i.e. srun worked external to the container, OFED worked
internal

The thing is I repeated this using OMPI 1.10.3 as well as 2.1.0 and that
seemed to work as well, which is great, but flys in the face of this

http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-hpc:

To achieve proper container=E2=80=99ized Open MPI support, you must use Ope=
n MPI
version 2.1


Any chance you can explain what "proper container'ized support" is? I think
Cedric and I both assumed that it meant as long as you had any old
libmpi.so.20 in the container orted would magically figure out how to use
OFED

PS. Happy to make a PR to update the docs, but I just want to understand
what 2.1 enables that 1.10 didn't.

Cheers,
--
Chris.
