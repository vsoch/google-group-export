It isn=E2=80=99t too horrible to setup a Jenkins server - we have it trigge=
red on every PR that gets filed so it can check that proposed change prior =
to commit. You could then check not only compile, but actual operation as w=
ell - e.g., build an image, launch an MPI job and verify that it runs succe=
ssfully using the updated code? I can point you to the =E2=80=9Cbot=E2=80=
=9D code we use to detect the issuing of a PR, pull it down, build it, test=
 it, and then mark the PR as =E2=80=9Csuccess=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cfailed=
=E2=80=9D.

I=E2=80=99m no Jenkins expert, but I can connect you to folks who have done=
 this if it would help.
