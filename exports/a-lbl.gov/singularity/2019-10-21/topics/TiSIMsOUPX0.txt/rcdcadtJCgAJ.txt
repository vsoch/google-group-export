This was built with v2.0, running on RHEL6 with a version from fairly
recent source installed:

  $ scilab
  WARNING: Template passwd not found:
  /tmp/.singularity-session-52888.64768.1068951//passwd
  ERROR  : Bind source path is not a file or directory: '/tmp/.singularity-session-52888.64768.1068951//passwd'

Also, at least importing from docker no longer works properly because
/singularity is ignored (which the above container also uses).

In case it's of interest, GitLab's continuous integration is supposed to
be one of its distinguishing features, but I don't know how useful it
is.  The need for root permissions precludes running checks in OS
package builds.

For anyone relying on test.sh, beware that it won't generally work
correctly as-is.  I wasted an embarrassing amount of time before
realizing that the path was lost under sudo in the setup I have, so it
was either mixing two sets of binaries or failing to find the
newly-built one.
