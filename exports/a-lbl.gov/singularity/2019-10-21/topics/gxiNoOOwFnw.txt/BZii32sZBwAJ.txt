Hey everyone,

I'm having a weird error. I am running the deepTools software inside a 
singularity container as part of a Nextflow workflow and am constantly 
running into a IOError: no space left on device error whenever I try 
running the pipelines.

However, if I run the exact same pipeline, let it error out, and then run 
the exact same deepTools command with the same files as the one in the 
nextflow script it runs perfectly fine. It's like the tmp file that exists 
inside the container is running out of space, but I don't even know if the 
singularity container creates one or uses the /tmp of the host system?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks.
