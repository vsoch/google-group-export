There has been some discussion on what environment variables to pass to the 
container from the host and what not, and, I admit I am lost at what's the 
current status. It'd be great if this could be documented somewhere (or if 
it is, please point me to it).

From what I can tell from Singularity 2.2.1, pretty much everything but 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH gets passed. 

Now, I am trying to clean up some environment variables and set up new ones 
(in particular, clearing LMod  from the host - CentOS7, and setting it up 
for the container - Ubuntu - some program/library locations are different 
on those 2 distros which would make it hacky to use single LMod install for 
both).  Additionally, LMod uses shell functions for command definitions 
which Singularity does not seem to pass so I'd have to source LMod again 
anyway (please, correct me if I am wrong here).

I can control this fairly simply on the user level, by putting something 
like this in ~/.bashrc:
if [ -n "$SINGULARITY_CONTAINER" ] && [ -n "$SINGULARITY_MOD" ]; then
  source /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/sys/modulefiles/scripts/clear_lmod.sh
  source /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/sys/installdir/lmod/7.4-u16/init/profile
fi

where I set SINGULARITY_MOD in /environment only in the containers that I 
want LMod to be active (clear_lmod.sh is my hack on clearing the LMod 
environment variables, the init/profile is LMod's standard initialization).

But, I would prefer to have this wrapped in the container so user did not 
need to modify their dot files. 

I first tried to put the two source lines to /etc/profile.d/, but it does 
not get accessed at the container (singularity shell) start, which makes me 
think that the shell is interactive non-login - so /etc/profile.d is 
ignored. Note that this is the way we have LMod set up on our clusters (and 
how TCL Modules do it as well), but, I figure that's because one ssh-es to 
the cluster so login shell sources /etc/profile.d.

Then I tried to put them in the /environment, but, while they do get 
executed and the environment variables changed, the shell function 
definitions don't get passed.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this and/or did they successfully put LMod 
in the container?

Thanks,
MC
