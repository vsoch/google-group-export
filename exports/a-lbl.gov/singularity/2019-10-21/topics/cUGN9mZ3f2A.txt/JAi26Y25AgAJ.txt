Subject: Re: [Singularity] ideal intermediate container format?

I think I sort of get the spirit of this question - this is this basic unit
of operation, of stuff, that when you put together constitutes the basis of
(most) containers. It probably comes down to:

- compressed dumps of files (docker layers, .tar.gz)
- environmental exports
- orchestration (eg, ports and execution results)

It would be amazing if there were a base format for describing these
things, for all containers, And I think that's (kind of) the goal of open
containers,etc:

https://www.opencontainers.org/
https://linuxcontainers.org/
https://coreos.com/blog/oci-image-specification.html

But yeah, to be real, people don't take the time to do this. So in a real,
use case sense, Docker is actually a pretty good unit of operation, when
you think about it. You can get at all the pieces of the above via the
manifest (to download the layers, and get the environment and user's
intended runtime). So my strategy, at least thus far, has always been to
start with Docker and then make Singularity from that. Even the running
commands are quite similar! This example is a little old now, but it gives
you the gist:

https://researchapps.github.io/clinical/reproducibility/2016/12/01/singularity-pefinder/

I think to make Singularity more powerful, we would want to find the use
cases that don't fit with "start from Docker." you mention an ACL file - do
you want to talk more about that?
