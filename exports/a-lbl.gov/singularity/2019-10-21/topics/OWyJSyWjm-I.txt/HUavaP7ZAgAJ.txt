The classic way to do this sort of this is with a  batch scheduler. I have
set up an render farm using Slurm.

Interesting thoiugh that you are using Celery for this task I was
discussing Celery over on the Julia language discussion boards,
as a method for dispatching thousands of tasks per day. It probably is a
very good fit for tasks like this.
I though rabbits are carrots though - maybe celery is good for them also.
