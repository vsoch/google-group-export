Cool thanks! I'll definitely let everyone know where there are stuffs to
test, probably not for a bit.

A quick update for everyone today - I started to write the function to
import a package (meaning the image, boutiques spec, and other meta data
files extracted with singularity-python), and realized that I'd want to
parse the list of files and folders in an image, the goal being to have a
set of "software tags" for singularity-hub to use to organize images. In
order for this list to be meaningful, the following would need to happen:

 - generate some lists for base images
 - subtract a container's list from its appropriate base image
 - the difference is the "meaningful" software!

I decided it made sense to have these singularity "diff" functions provided
in singularity-python
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/issues/7>, however
my first task would be to have singularity containers for a bunch of
different OS. I can get lists easily from Docker
<https://github.com/docker/docker/wiki/Public-docker-images>, or Docker Hub
(because the easiest way to make the images is arguably to generate them
from the already robust set of docker). But then when I started to write a
script in python to do this conversion en-masse, I realized the
functionality missing would be to have a complete python wrapper for the
bash tool, so today I made one
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/blob/master/singularity/cli.py>,
and check out how it works here
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/tree/master/examples/run_singularity>
.

Greg is working actively (right now I think!) on an update for the
singularity bash command line tool, and I'll update the wrapper after that
- there seems to be a bug with the export function (that used to work) to
export a docker image. The rest seems to work! When that's done, then I'm
going to write a beastly script to make a crapton of singularity images
from docker ones, and probably do some fun NLP stuffs on the lists of files
to generate some reasonable software bases. This is going to be pretty
cool, because if you think about it, there isn't really good understanding
out there about what software is provided in base OS to begin with, let
along having some method to compare them. THEN I'll go back to writing the
package import function (which will generate software tags, along with
importing the boutiques stuffs I made yesterday) and making the interface
--> API --> blabla bla.


Best,

Vanessa
