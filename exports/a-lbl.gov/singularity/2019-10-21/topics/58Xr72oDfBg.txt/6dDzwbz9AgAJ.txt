Hi Venessa,

Unfortunately bootstrapping with the command you suggested did changed the=
=20
permission of the file. What else can I try? Thanks..

singularity create --size 6000 test.img
sudo singularity bootstrap test.img file.def

Bootstrap: docker
From: docker://evolinc/evolinc-i:1.2=20
%post=20
    chmod u+x /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/.wh.six-1.5.2.egg-info=20
%runscript=20
     exec evolinc-part-I.sh "$@"


vagrant@vagrant:~$ singularity shell test.img=20
Singularity test.img:~> ls -lh /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/.wh.six-1.5=
.
2.egg-info
---x------ 1 root root 0 May  3 00:40 /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/.wh.
