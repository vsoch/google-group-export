Hi Oliver,

Please see my explanation to Lars above on why these checks matter at build
time.

Hi Igor,

Just as I suspected, I am unable to replicate your issue.  Don't really
know what to say.

Lars is completely right. <br>
<br>
Checking for something at build time which matters at runtime is clearly a =
bug. <br>
If you look around at Linux distros people are using, 99 % of the packages =
used in the world have *not* been compiled on the machine they are running =
on. <br>
Hence, it&#39;s just the wrong approach checking in the build environment f=
or something you want to ensure at runtime. <br>
<br>
We already went down this road earlier, if you remember:<br>

=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://github.com/singularity<wbr>ware/s=

<br>
For example, we build our RPMs and DEBs on the OpenBuildService. There&#39;=
s no reason the kernels there should match the kernels on the machines we d=
eploy those DEBs / RPMs to. <br>
If the official statement from Sylabs is, that nobody cares for packaging i=
n RPMs and DEBs, that&#39;s of course a statement. Apparently, this is the =
case, since this kind of issues are repeated again and again. <br>
It seems there are fundamental issues with how package deployment on Linux =
systems work in general. <br>
<br>
That&#39;s completely unrelated to the fact that of course everybody should=
 update their build machines to modern kernels. I fully agree with that. Bu=
t please don&#39;t implement checks at the wrong place just because it seem=

There is a correct place, and the rest of the world is using it. There&#39;=

</span><span>&gt; Hi Lars,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Here&#39;s my take on this.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you really want to override the tests and build Singularity on a sy=
stem that does not implement the NO_NEW_PRIVS features you can always modif=
y the code.=C2=A0 It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to figure out where the test=
s are occurring and what steps must be taken to disable them.=C2=A0 I think=
 this is better than providing a built-in override option.=C2=A0 Running Si=
ngularity in any way shape or form on systems without NO_NEW_PRIVS=C2=A0is =
not supported.=C2=A0 Nobody is going to be testing older versions of the ke=
rnel for undiscovered vulnerabilities that might still affect Singularity.=
=C2=A0 If an admin just absolutely cannot be bothered to upgrade their head=
/build node to support this feature than they must do what they feel is rig=
ht.=C2=A0 But by modifying the source code they are stating that they know =
what they are doing and they are happy to be on their own.=C2=A0=C2=A0<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Hi!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I&#39;m a bit surprised that there&#39;s a blocking=
 test for kernel capabilities on the build host, shouldn&#39;t that be a ru=
ntime concern?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I can&#39;t at find any override for these tests, w=
hich may be of use for people building on head/build nodes or preparing deb=
/RPM:s.<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I&#39;m surprised that you got that e=
