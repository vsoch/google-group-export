Remy,

This is indeed where I'm heading with Singularity apps! Additionally, I was
thinking of Github for this or at least an initial version. Great minds!!

I do want to get it released (1.0) first because so much is still changing
from commit to commit, but I would like to get some apps posted/shared for
people to test and have something to start with. Is this something you
would be able to help with?

Thanks!
