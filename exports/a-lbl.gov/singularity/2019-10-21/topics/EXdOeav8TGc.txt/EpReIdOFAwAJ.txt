Hi Stefan,

The user namespace is like the shiny golden unicorn that everybody wants,
but it is generally not considered stable in the kernels that many
distributions are using. The user namespace has created lots of CVEs, DOSs,
and a variety of kernel panics and thus Red Hat has not enabled it by
default in RHEL7.2. They are calling it a "technology preview" and not
supporting that feature. Additionally their implementation is half baked
because it does not include all of the features as you will find in later
kernels (e.g.  the ability to virtualization other mount namespaces from
the user namespace).

This is one reason why the SUID pathway is preferred,... So singularity
works on today's systems. Also because even on the latest systems, and
kernels, the ability to mount Singularity images is not supported via user
namespace. Hopefully that will change sometime soon, but until then the
SUID code will be our pretend unicorn. Lol

Greg
