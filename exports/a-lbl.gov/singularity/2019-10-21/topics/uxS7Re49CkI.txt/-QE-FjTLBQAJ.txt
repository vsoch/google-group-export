Hi Thomas!

How recent of a kernel?

It's not really Singularity related, but there's an increasing jungle of cg=
roup functionality that might allow something like. This came to mind:

https://lwn.net/Articles/698073/

In the 4.10 kernel though....

Not really Singularity-related, but might be an interesting generic feature=
.  Could maybe wrap Singularity with it?

Brian
