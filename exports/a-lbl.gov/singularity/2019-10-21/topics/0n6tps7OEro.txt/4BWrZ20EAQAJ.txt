Hey Chris,

+1 to PR to the docs! And we just had some work on this recently:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/blob/docs/2.3/=
pages/docs/admin-docs/docs-hpc.md#integration-with-mpi

If you have additions to make, or specific points you want clarified, would
you mind posting a PR for that page? We should have the docs for 2.3
released with your questions answered. Thanks!

Best,

Vanessa
