Hi,
I have tried a slightly different scenario: I put a vncserver in the
container along with the DE (Mate in my case since our userbase is
accustomed to the gnome2 interface). It worked reasonably well, but there
were definitely wart that I hadn't worked through yet. I'm not working on
it ATM, but intend to return over the next few weeks (I also want to pub a
guacamole server in the container).

Dear Sylabs, is there a community wiki you would like us to put stuff like
this in? Or would you rather us make PRs on the documentation?

Cheers,
--
Chris.
