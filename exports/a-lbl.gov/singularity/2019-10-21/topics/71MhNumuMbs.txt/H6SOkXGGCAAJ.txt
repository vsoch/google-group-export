Hello,

   I am a new user of Singularity, and I just realized that several 
applications I wish to run require the creation of temporary files in 
/run/shm and /run/lock.
For instance, the Python multiprocessing library cannot create semaphores 
if /dev/shm (symlinked to /run/shm in recent distros) is not mounted.
As far as I can tell, these are not mounted as tmpfs filesystems in the 
default Debian configuration. I was wondering if this is by design,
and what would be the appropriate workaround/solution. Thanks and best 
regards,

  -Ivan Raikov
