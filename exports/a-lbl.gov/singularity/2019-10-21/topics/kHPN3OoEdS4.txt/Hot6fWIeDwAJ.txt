Hi Vanessa,

I realised my confusion regarding the .conf file (reading the inline 
documentation in singularity.conf more carefully could have easily cleared 
that up). My impression was that the config is stored in the image itself 
and not on the host machine. In hindsight this doesn't really make sense, I 
have to admit.
So indeed looking at /etc/singularity/ on my machine (not in the image) I 
see

default-nsswitch.conf  init  singularity.conf

as you said and modifying singularity.conf leads to the expected behaviour 
when running singularity with my generated slc6 image.

To give some context, I'm testing singularity since we intend to use it in 
our local computing cluster and potentially also on the LRZ computing 
cluster in Munich. This includes trying out some configurations in 
singularity.conf, in this case setting some default bind paths that are 
common to all machines in the cluster.

Sorry for the confusion and thanks for help!

Cheers,

Thomas
