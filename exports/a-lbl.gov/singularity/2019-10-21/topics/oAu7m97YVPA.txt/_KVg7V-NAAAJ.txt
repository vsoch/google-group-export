Subject: Re: [Singularity] Compatibility between kernel and OS. Can new "OS"'s
 run with older kernels?

The kernel is the one piece that is shared between the container and its
host operating system environment. Everything else you can overlay with
different versions (applications, libraries, etc.), but kernel calls still
go straight through to the kernel running the host OS. For this reason, it
is far more common to use containers to run code that requires older
operating systems than to try to run newer OS versions on an older host OS.
