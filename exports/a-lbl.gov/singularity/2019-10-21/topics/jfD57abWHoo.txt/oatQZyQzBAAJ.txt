AH.  Got it.  I had (don't remember why):

%environment
    TMPDIR=TMPDIR
    TMP=TMP
    TEMP=TEMP
    export TMPDIR TMP TEMP 

in my container def.  Fixing it now!

<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; if you create a Singularity container natively,=

<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; Else, if you have imported a container from Doc=

<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 maybe can
<br>&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; trick it by creating a sandboxed version and ad=
