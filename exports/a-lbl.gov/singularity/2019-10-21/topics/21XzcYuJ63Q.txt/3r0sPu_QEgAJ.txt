Hi Yong,

1) yes the host have an functioning IB with Mellanox OFED Driver.=20
2) No i didn=C2=B4t installed the IB stack in the Container because i think=

container wants to see the IB Card. But when i Use the --net flag the=20
container will boot up in a diffrent Subnet as the host. And i can=C2=B4t m=

to Access a container with an own LAN IP adress.
