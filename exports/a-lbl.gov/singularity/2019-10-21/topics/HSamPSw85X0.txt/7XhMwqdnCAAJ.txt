So I never got these suggestions working, but I did get a solution that is 
a bit hacky, but works:

https://github.com/gearslaboratory/gears-singularity/blob/master/singularity-definitions/development/Singularity.gears-slurm

Basically, I made little text files for each command mapped to what I want 
it to do.  

This works!
