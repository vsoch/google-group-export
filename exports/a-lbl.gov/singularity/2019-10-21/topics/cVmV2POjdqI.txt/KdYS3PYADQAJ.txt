Got it working with the DESTDIR method. And I noticed many more files as 
part of the archive!

This is definitely the most complete method.

To unpack the tar, the following works (only tested within the Docker 
container because I am cautious of interfering with other files in similar 
locations on my host):

`tar -xzvf ${SING_BUILD_HOME}/singularity-v3.0.2-rc2.tar.gz -C /`

Is there a safer way to place all the files within the archive in their 
correct locations?

For the record, this is what the unpack tar command contains. It seems to 
interact with many of the system directories. I just don't know if it is 
changing things that other software might depend on.

Are the tar command line interface flags, --no-overwrite-dir and 
--keep-old-files enough to ensure safety?
