Hi Vanessa,

Thanks. I did infact build it locally and used vagrant scp to get form the 
vm to my local machine and then copy-pasted the image to the cluster. I am 
using singularity-2.4 on my local machine but the cluster (CentOS) is 
running on singularity-2.5.2 if I remember correctly.

Yes so I basically did not create the container from scratch using a 
Dockerfile (although now I think I should have), but due the hesitation of 
being a newbie I just pulled a container from docker://icepack/firedrake 
and made some changes, and used docker commit to eventually push it to 
dockerHub.

Yes this happened for me too. I was not able to figure out the exact

Ok, I am going to try that. Fortunately enough, the cluster admins were 
able to create a recipe with firedrake installed and I pushed it to 
SingularityHub here: shub://bhaveshshrimali/singularityFiredrake. I will 
check if this runs for me. Thanks for your help and time. I will post here 
if anything goes wrong and am not able to figure out by simple googling.

>1. I built a Docker image with firedrake installed (docker://bhaveshshrima=
li/<wbr>firedrakestable2:try2Jan23) and am trying singularity pull &lt;dock=
er_image:image_tag&gt; in order to build a singularity image on my computer=
. Firstly, when I construct the image I always see the installed folder (or=
 any other folders that I created in the Docker image) in my root directory=
.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Is there a way to avoid that ? Also, when =
I do singularity build &lt;image_name.simg&gt; docker://&lt;image_name:imag=
e_<wbr>tag&gt; on my local machine, I get the following warning:=C2=A0</div=
