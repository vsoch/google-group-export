Hi Nathan,

Nope, using 'bind path' is basically the same as a mount. Once you mount a
directory ontop of another, you can no longer get access to the directory
below it (there are hacks, but they are not reasonable). I'm not sure that
you want to mix things like library or binary paths between container and
host because it possibly breaks container portability.

On the other hand, I maybe misreading what you are hoping to do... lol
