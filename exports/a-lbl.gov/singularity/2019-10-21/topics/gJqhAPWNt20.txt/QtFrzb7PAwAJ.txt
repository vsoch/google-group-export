Hi Julien,

Maybe, in a near future, with the OCI compatibility for singularity, you
will be able to use Singularity within k8s and/or nextflow. A good starting
point is to take a look at Magnus which allow to create a k8s cluster
within OpenStack : https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Magnum

Kind regards,
R=C3=A9my

PS : I will give a Singularity workshop at "ust4hpc" event. Arnaud from
Romeo will be there; maybe we could talk a bit about that.
