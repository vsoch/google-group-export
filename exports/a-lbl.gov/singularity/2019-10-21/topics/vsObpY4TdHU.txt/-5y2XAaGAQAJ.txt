Hi,

Hum... Here are the singularity commands with suid bit:

```
remy@atlas:/usr/local/libexec$ sudo find . -perm -4000



./singularity/bin/mount-suid
./singularity/bin/create-suid
./singularity/bin/action-suid
./singularity/bin/export-suid
./singularity/bin/import-suid
./singularity/bin/expand-suid
```

That is to say each of these command can affect the host to become root on
it. Except for `action-suid` where I do not know when it is needed (maybe
during bootstrap ?), all these commands can be run as a regular user.

However, if there is a vulnerability inside a container, I don't know how
it can affect the host... Especially, if suid operations are forbidden
inside the container... That something I asked on the slack channel, but I
didn't get any answer...

I will update the google doc with Q/A.

Thanks
