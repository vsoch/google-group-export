Hello all,

I'm new to singularity and to this group.  First, thanks for making this 
tool available.

I've got a container image that has an OS (CentOS 6 for now) and a 
collection of C/C++ compilers and so on.  This is working fine.

What I'd like to do is get access to a large directory tree inside the 
container.  For many reasons, I don't want to copy the (large)
tree into the container image.  What I'd like to do is form an overlay file 
system inside the container where the lower, read-only
layer is the large directory tree on the host's disk and the upper, 
read-write level of the overlay file system would point to another
directory tree that is located elsewhere.

I've tried this:
        $ singularity image.create overlay-experiment.img
        $ singularity shell --bind /path/to/dev/tree:/work:ro --overlay 
overlay-experiment.img Centos_6_7.img

This didn't work.  Inside the container, if I try to touch/modify a file, 
Singularity complains that the file system is read only.  If I
remove the ':ro', I can touch/edit files but the /path/to/dev/tree file 
system is modified.  ie, it's not functioning as an overlay.

Maybe my understanding of overlays is weak.  Is there a combination of 
arguments that will give me the arrangement I'm after?

Thanks, in advance, for any help you can provide,

David
