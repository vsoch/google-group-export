Its just a text file that allows my whole organization to use the license,=
=20
but it has to be placed in a very specific location.  That is why I was=20
hoping to symlink from a mounted directory given an environment variable.

Is it possible to do this within a container definition?  Let's assume the=
=20
file is in the "true" location of:

~/mylicensefile.txt

I set this as an environment variable of:
MYLICENSEFILE=3D"~/mylicensefile.txt"

And I want to have it appear at runtime within the singularity container=20
(say an Ubuntu one) at:
/APPS/myapp/mylicensefile.txt (perhaps with the error check of if it is=20
missing from the "global environment" the symlink isn't created?)

It seems like %files isn't the right method, because it occurs when=20
building the container, right (so I'd be distributing my license file which=
=20
is not ok)?  I want this post-build. =20
