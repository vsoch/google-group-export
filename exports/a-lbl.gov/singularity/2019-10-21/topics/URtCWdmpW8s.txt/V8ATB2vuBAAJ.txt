Hi Jason,

It kinda depends on the MPI version. With Open MPI 2.1 (pre-release) the IB
communication would occur on the host's OMPI installation, so the container
doesn't even need an IB/OFED aware OMPI install. As far as multi-node MPI
goes, as long as you use the right version of OMPI, you can just follow the
walkthrough here:

http://singularity.lbl.gov/#hpc

Hope that helps, and let me know how it works out for ya!

Greg
