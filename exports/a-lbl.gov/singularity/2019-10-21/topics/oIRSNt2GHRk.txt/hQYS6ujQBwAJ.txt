Hi all,

I've seen many examples of one application being ported to many systems. 
But: Is there the possibility to execute several applications in several 
systems?

I have several codes, and I am interested in executing them in different 
clusters, but keeping Singularity as my "software suite" and moving the 
image among these clusters. This will mean that my binary will find 
libraries and headers inside the Singularity image. 

This would be useful for portability of a software suite (where the codes 
are constantly updated). Notice that in my case I will have to move this 
image between systems where I don't have root permissions.

Best regards,
Albert.
