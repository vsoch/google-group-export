Sandeep,

singularity can be run without setuid-root on RHEL systems only on the 
recently released EL7.4, and only if a couple of options are enabled, a 
boot option and a sysctl option.  I can give you details if you're 
interested.  There's also a couple of other restrictions in that you can't 
enable overlay (so bind mounts have to already exist in the image) and you 
have to have an image directory tree and not an image file (because image 
files require a loopback mount).
