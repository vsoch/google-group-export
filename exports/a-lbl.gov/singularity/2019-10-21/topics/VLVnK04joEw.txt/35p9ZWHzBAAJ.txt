I=E2=80=99ve been pondering a related issue lately. Suppose I create a cont=
ainer that includes a licensed library, and then I migrate that container t=
o another cluster. Depending on how the license is enforced (e.g., a licens=
e manager daemon vs a local =E2=80=9Ctoken=E2=80=9D), I may now be operatin=
g the container in violation of the license.

Now suppose I distribute the container - have I now enabled everyone to use=
 that licensed software without paying for it? You have a similar problem w=
ith your proposal - what if I distribute the encryption key along with the =
container?

Related question: suppose the library is actually GPL. Now GPL doesn=E2=80=
=99t hold sway unless you distribute your software. If you statically link =
your code against a GPL library and then distribute that binary, we know th=
at makes your code subject to the GPL.

However, if I put a GPL library in a container, and then distribute the con=
tainer - have I now caused my code that links against that library at runti=
me to become subject to GPL? I am distributing the combination, albeit they=
 are not actually combined until you run the container.

Makes my head hurt...
