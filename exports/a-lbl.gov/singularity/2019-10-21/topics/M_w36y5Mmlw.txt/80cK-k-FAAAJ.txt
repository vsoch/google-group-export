Hey Chris,

Right now, you could make a singularity container with singularity
installed, and issue commands to it (with appropriate permissions) to do
some action with Singularity internally. The same rules apply - the user
inside the container is the user outside the container. What you can do now
is execute running commands that aren't akin to services, like a scientific
analysis, job, etc. What you can't yet do (at least without producing some
ghost processes that you lose control of) is start a service inside a
container (that itself starts and stops) and expect that the service that
you've launched will be under your control. What you *could* do is have a
single container consistently running (eg, the user is shelled into it) and
then from there run additional containers. As for the "launching" part this
would make most sense in some kind of job manager context, in which case
you would just be issuing a command to some node to load singularity and
run a job. Again, we are already sort of outside the container.

The functionality that is needed to seriously consider these kinds of ideas
is under development (the feature-daemon branch), Michael Bauer is lead and=
 we
are working together to test and make better
<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/830#issuecomment-317=
881310>
- your feedback and comments would be greatly appreciated!

Best,

Vanessa

<br>I&#39;d be inclined to write generally in terms of separate concerns:

<br>
<br>&gt; Another question that could be added ? Can I run nested container =

<br>Right, related to the separation of concerns and how things compose.=C2=
