Hi
I did not notice that kind of issue using GPU/namd.
In fact, it was the opposite. Indeed, I plan to use singularity on our
future gpu solution for deep learning.

So I think it is related to what you are doing and your cafe version.

Hey Dmitri,

It doesn't seem like a clean comparison to be comparing different versions
of cafe. From the different tests I've done (and from what I've seen from
others) Singularity is typically comparable to running on the host. Are you
able to set up a test between using and not using Singularity with a
consistent Caffe version?

For example, there was a typo --> https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/
0d20df51901550f1b7eb2d56e0a84df5d6e2f029 in the AccuracyLayer, which
according to this group post
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/caffe-users/memory%7Csort:relev=
ance/caffe-users/Kki0U5Nc_Ks/2bhgAHUTBAAJ>,
has a lot to do with memory usage. We just can't determine if it's
singularity given two different versions of caffe - it's the same as it is
with a scientific experiment, you have to control for everything but the
variable you want to vary (using singularity or not).

Best,

Vanessa
