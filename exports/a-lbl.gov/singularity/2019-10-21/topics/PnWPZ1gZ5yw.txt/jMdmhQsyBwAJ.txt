We dont have OverlayFS but using '--bind' with a pre-made root directory of 
the same name within the container (e.g. '/ifs') and '--home' with a 
temporary directory seems to have solved it. Any other combination seems to 
result in the $PWD getting broken and the host path becoming inaccessible 
when programs try to run in the container.
