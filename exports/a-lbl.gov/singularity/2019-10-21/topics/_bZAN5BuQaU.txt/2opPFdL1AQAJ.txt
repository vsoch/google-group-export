We're having challenges with the development phase of singularity, where we 
really need to develop our image co-located with our data/hardware, but it 
is on an HPC where we don't have root access.  If we build a REALLY simple 
image on a root'ed system via --writeable or sandbox or something, can we 
move it to the HPC (non-root) system and the shell -> apt-get install etc. 
stuff on the image?  Or does the use of non-root singularity runtime 
systems mean we can't modify the image on those systems?
