Thank you for the quick reply.

If eventually found official documentation that states / confirms what=20
you're saying.  Under the **Admin Documentation** section 'Troubleshooting'=
=20
(http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-troubleshooting):

"Singularity must be installed by root into a location that allows for=20
`SUID` programs to be executed (as described above in the installation=20
section of this manual). If you fail to do that, you may have user=E2=80=99=
s=20
reporting one of the following error conditions:

ERROR  : Singularity must be executed in privileged mode to use images
ABORT  : Retval =3D 255

[...]

If one of these errors is reported, it is best to check the installation of=
=20
Singularity and ensure that it was properly installed by the root user onto=
=20
a local file system."

Some quick feedback-to-maintainers comments as a fresh users:

* FYI, googling for "Singularity must be executed in privileged mode to use=
=20
images" doesn't give you much useful information, which I found a bit=20
surprising actually.  I eventually found it by grep:ing the source code.=20
 Can also be found by searching the GitHub repository=20
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/.

* As a user (non-admin) who installed Singularity from source, I wouldn't=
=20
really expect the above section to be under the 'Admin Documentation' but=
=20
rather under the 'User Documentation'.

* Would it possible to make the error messages a bit more informative;=20
they're informative when you know what's going on, but before that it's not=
=20
clear.  Maybe add "See the Admin Documentation for more details"?

* Under 'Install on Linux' there is a sentence "The =E2=80=98make install=
=E2=80=99 is=20
required to be run as root to get a properly installed Singularity=20
implementation.", which I guess refers to this SUID issue.  A reference=20
such as "(see Admin Documentation for reasons)" could help emphasize this.=
=20
 Adding "If the Singularity executable is not installed as root, then=20
user's will only be able to launch Singularity instances in the form of=20
directories, but to images." (this is referring to Greg's post=20
"Unprivileged Singularity containers? Oh yes!" on 2016-08-13,=20
https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!topic/singularity/DUJZzvKx8eQ).

* Could `make install` detect if it's running as non-root and give warning=
=20
about the above?

(I'm happy to add these wishes / suggestions as issues on GitHub, but I'm=
=20
too new to the community to know whether you prefer to first discuss issues=
=20
here on the mailing lists before creating more formal issues).


About installing via RPMs: I'm not really sysadm so I cannot do that=20
myself.  This is why I also tried to install Singularity as a regular user.=
=20
 It was quite easy to miss the requirement that Singularity needs to be=20
installed as root.

Cheers,

Henrik
