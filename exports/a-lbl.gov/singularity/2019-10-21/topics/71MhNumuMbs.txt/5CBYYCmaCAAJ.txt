Hi Ivan,

Yes you are 100% correct about that. So I would recommend using the bind
path directive in the config file to point at /run. That way you can use
the host's /run directory which has other benefits (well,.. not for HPC but
other factors e.g. audio support) haha.

Does that option seem reasonable to you? If not, I'm open to other ideas if
something special needs to be coded in (e.g. mount /run as a tmpfs on
container invocation).

Thanks!
