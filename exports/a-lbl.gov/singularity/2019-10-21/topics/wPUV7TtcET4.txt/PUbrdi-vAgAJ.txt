There are only a few cases where it would even be possible to be calling
the host's python from within the container:

* The container is not actually running (unlikey if you are calling with
something like `singularity exec ....`).
* You have python installed into a shared location (e.g. `$HOME/bin` or any
other path shared between the containers (in which case, Vanessa's
suggestion will fix)
* Your bootstrap file did something very weird. I don't know what, but if
so it must be weird and I'd like to see it. haha

Hope that helps!

I&#39;m developing a python package that is published on pypi. On my<br>
computer I have it installed in &quot;editable mode&quot; [0] to test it.<b=

However, I sometime need to run the last stable version of the<br>
software. Although I can do it with virtualenv, I thought of creating<br>
a Singularity container to allow me to experiment with Singularity.<br>
<br>
I created a container that install the last version of the software<br>
from pypi. But when I&#39;m running it with the user (ie, not root), the<br=
>
version of the software that it uses is the one on the host, not the<br>
one from the container. When the container is run with root, it uses<br>
the stable version from the container.<br>
<br>
What could be the reason of this behaviour, and how could I fix this?<br>
I build singularity from git, last commit 26e35168c49<br>
