Hi Greg,

Thanks for your comments. Indeed, I also did several tests and finally I
found what you just said. That by specifying the /home in the bind path
usually works. First, I tried to bind /home/oguitart but it didn't work.
However, binding /home works fine. Anyway, it is good to know.
Regards,


oriol

Hi All,<br>
<br>
I found another issue on my tests about singularity. In our group, we<br>
have our home directories that link to another directory which is<br>
mounted in nfs. In the singularity.conf, I have specified a bind path to<br=
>
the nfs mounted directory and it works fine, I can see it when I&#39;m<br>
inside the container. However, when it tries to mount the home directory<br=

I get this message:<br>
<br>
ERROR=C2=A0 : Failed to mount home directory /home/oguitart: Permission den=
ied<br>
ABORT=C2=A0 : Retval =3D 255<br>
<br>
How is that possible that the nfs home directory can be mounted but my<br>
/home/oguitart which is actually pointing to the nfs home directory<br>
can&#39;t be mounted in the container? Why don&#39;t I have permissions? Is=
 not<br>
my user who is launching the singularity container?<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
