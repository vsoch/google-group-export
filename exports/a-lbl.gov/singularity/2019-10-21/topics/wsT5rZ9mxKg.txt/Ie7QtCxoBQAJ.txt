Hey Mike,

I can definitely help answer this one! Do you mean Singularity Registry
Server, or Singularity Hub? They are slightly different so I can adjust my
answer based on that. The short answer is that the tag of "latest" is
nothing special other than the default tag used given that the user doesn't
specify a tag (eg., built from the "Singularity" file in the Github repo
(no extension) or pulled without specifying a tag
(shub://vsoch/hello-world. This is a convention taken from Docker, and to
be honest I don't think it's the best practice, because "latest" now is not
"latest" later. It's much better to generally pull with a version (either a
commit or container hash for Singularity Hub) and as a builder, you don't
need to thin about this (it is figured out automatically from the container
and from your repository).

For Singularity Registry, we can't derive a commit, but we can derive the
container hash. So generally I would think of a tag as a moving thing
(e.g., latest today isn't latest tomorrow) and when you interact with
images (such as specifying usage of one in a script) it's best practice to
include the hash (shub://<username>/<repo>:<tag>@<hash>

What is missing for Singularity Registry are better hooks into CI (Circle
or Travis) which actually I've shown before with Travis --->
https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-ci/ that would push and also
provide the container for the registry to include a way back to its source
(the Github repo and commit!). The good news is that we don't need some
special builder or plugin, just an example recipe that will do the build
and push. I'd be happy to write this up for you (was planning on updating
that repo and making one for Circle too :)

Best,

Vanessa
