Subject: Auto-creation of mount points and container portability

Hi,
Apologies in advance if I am missing something from previous email
exchanges or github chats.

When I try to run an image I get the following error:

WARNING: Non existant 'bind point' in container: '/scratch'
WARNING: Non existant 'bind point' in container: '/local-scratch'

I assume this is because admin has decided to mount /scratch and
/local-scratch from the host file system, but those mount points do not
exist in the container. This brings up a broader question - how can I build
portable containers without knowing which folders will be mounted by admins
on the executions system? Would it be possible that singularity created
those 'bind points' inside containers that do not have them? Or maybe it is
even possible to do by having a smart runscript that reads some environment
variables and creates missing mount points?

Best,
Chris
