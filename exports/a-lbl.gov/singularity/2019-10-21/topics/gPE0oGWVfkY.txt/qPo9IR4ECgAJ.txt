It's normal, daemon processes uses double fork to be attached to the init 
process and avoid zombie processes, that's why singularity process don't 
own your apache process even if you logout from container, between 
singularity shouldn't be able to unmount the bind partitions because apache 
process uses files in container resulting in a no clean state.

In order to work, Singularity should implement PID namespsaces with 
start/stop commands. PID namespaces will allow Singularity to become the 
init process in order to own daemon processes running inside container and 
make a clean exit with stop command

Best regards,
Cedric Clerget
