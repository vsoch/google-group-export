Hey Florian,

We are working on a similar project called "Containers FTW" for which
people submit containers via PRs to a repo - I'm still developing the
infrastructure but you can read about it here:
https://containers-ftw.github.io/

Singularity Hub doesn't use VMs - it deploys entire instances on Google
Cloud to do an entire build with some additional metrics and checks. If you
want to send me the Github repo you were trying to build I'd be happy to
look into the issue for you, and for future notice you can post issues you
are having on our issue board
<https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/issues>. The
collection you sent is private so others won't be able to see the link,
doing some basic searching I found this repo -->
https://github.com/flogo/ipc-demo-submission and I can tell you right away
it wouldn't build if there is no Singularity (the build recipe file) in the
repo base. If you want to point me to your repo / build spec, I'd be happy
to help, and I hope you reach out in future cases instead of just giving up!

For your purposes, I think using continuous integration to build and test
metrics would suit quite well, and this is what I'm developing for
containers-ftw. If you find another approach it would be fun to chat about
it! If you want VMs, you can look at our collection on vagratup
<https://app.vagrantup.com/singularityware>. I also will likely be
releasing "builder" ones soon for the singularity registry, but this would
be simple to create by just adding your build script to be run by the VM.

Best,

Vanessa
