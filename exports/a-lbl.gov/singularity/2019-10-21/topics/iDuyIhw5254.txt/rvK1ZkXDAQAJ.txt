TL;DR

@Tru: master of tar ;)

@joshua: That seems to really looks like Distroless
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/distroless or even this PR from
C=C3=A9dric Clerget to create a minimal container from a strace :
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/739
Otherwise, I would create an empty container and importing everything
needed using `singularity shell -w -B ...`, binding needed path and then,
copying what is needed or using bootstrap/%files
