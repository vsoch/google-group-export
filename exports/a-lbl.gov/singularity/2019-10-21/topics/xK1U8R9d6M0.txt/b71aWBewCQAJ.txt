Hi Jason,

Thanks for the response.  I was running an older version of singularity 
installed by our IT
dept so I downloaded/installed the 2.4.5 release and made the change as you 
suggested.

The change in ordering didn't affect the behaviour.  ie, with the :ro 
qualifier on the --bind
argument, the mounted directory cannot be modified; without the :ro 
qualifier, data is "written
through" to the host's directory tree.  (I removed the --overlay argument 
just to see if this had
any effect.  It didn't.)

If I run the mount command inside the container, I'm seeing just the / 
partition.  There's no
indication of an overlay mount.  Is this expected?

I ran singularity with the --debug option and saw lots of output but 
nothing that told my
inexperienced eyes anything useful.

Any other suggestions?  Thanks for the help, by the way.  Much appreciated,

David
