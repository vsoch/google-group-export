Hi All,

I found another issue on my tests about singularity. In our group, we have 
our home directories that link to another directory which is mounted in 
nfs. In the singularity.conf, I have specified a bind path to the nfs 
mounted directory and it works fine, I can see it when I'm inside the 
container. However, when it tries to mount the home directory I get this 
message: 

ERROR  : Failed to mount home directory /home/oguitart: Permission denied
ABORT  : Retval = 255

How is that possible that the nfs home directory can be mounted but my 
/home/oguitart which is actually pointing to the nfs home directory can't 
be mounted in the container? Why don't I have permissions? Is not my user 
who is launching the singularity container?
Thanks,


oriol
