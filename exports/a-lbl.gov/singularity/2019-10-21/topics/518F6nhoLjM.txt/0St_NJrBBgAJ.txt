Subject: Re: [Singularity] which Ubuntu 16.04.4 kernel would work with
 singularity 2.5.1?
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hrmmm... I'm confused here... Why on that first instance of
PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS does it not know what it is, but then a few lines
later it suggests PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS as a replacement to
PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS....

Can you try putting in the full path to cc? i.e.  /usr/bin/cc
-I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu NO_NEW_PRIVS_test.c -o
NO_NEW_PRIVS_test

-J
