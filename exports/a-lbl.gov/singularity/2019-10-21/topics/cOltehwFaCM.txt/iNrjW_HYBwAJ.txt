Great to see singularity being adopted by new clusters!

<div>Singularity is a platform to support users that have different environ=
mental needs then what is provided by the resource or service provider. Whi=
le the high level perspective of other container solutions seems to fill th=
is niche very well, the
 current implementations are focused on network service virtualization rath=
er than application level virtualization focused on the HPC space. Because =
of this, Singularity leverages a workflow and security model that makes it =
a very reasonable candidate for
 shared or multi-tenant HPC resources like Comet without requiring any modi=
fications to the scheduler or system architecture. Additionally, all typica=
l HPC functions can be leveraged within a Singularity container (e.g. Infin=
iBand, high performance file systems,
 GPUs, etc.).</div><span class=3D"HOEnZb"><font color=3D"#888888">
