Hi All:

I was wondering if anyone had a recipe, set of instructions, blog, etc. on 
how to setup networking in Singularity.  I am looking to meet the following 
needs:

   - Setup a singularity container that has a static IP address on the same 
   subnet as the host 
   - e.g. if the host is on 192.168.1.5, the container can have an address 
      of 192.168.1.8
   - The container can talk to any address that the Host can (including the 
   host's IP address)
   - The containers network interface is as fast as (or nearly as fast as) 
   the host's network interface.  
   - i.e. if the network interface is 10Gb, and the host can send/receive 
      on it at 8Gb, than the container can send/receive at that rate also
   
I have read through the network page: 
https://sylabs.io/guides/3.3/user-guide/networking.html?highlight=network
but it does not have a good example of what I am trying to achieve.

Thanks in advance,
Paul
