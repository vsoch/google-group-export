Hi Greg,

I was wondering if you could just provide a little more information about 
the /environment file. Mostly, I was wondering when you think is the best 
time to edit this file. I had no trouble manually editing the file after I 
had bootstrapped the image, but I would prefer to have the process be 
automated. However, when I tried to edit it in my definition file (by 
appending a couple lines of bash to /environment) that didn't seem to work. 
Is the file not created at this point? I'm sure I can figure out if I have 
some bugs or typos in the code I wrote. I was just wondering when you 
thought the best time to edit the /environment file was.

Thanks!
Nathan
