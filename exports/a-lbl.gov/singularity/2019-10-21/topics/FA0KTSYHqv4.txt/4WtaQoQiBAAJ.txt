I don't understand how yaml is significantly different from JSON, but
they're both going to make processing in shell scripts much harder than
necessary.  What's wrong with simple key-value data?  (Otherwise I'll
propose s-expressions, which have been doing such jobs for decades.)

[Apart from head, see what file(1) says.]

I'm not sure what the latter means.

Yes, definitely don't make everyone to go down that sort of root!  We're
talking Unix, and I want abstraction, modularity and composition.  [I
say so from scripting scientific "workflows" since long before I heard
the term and before I used Unix, and I've suffered "e-science"...]

Do have documentation and useful metadata, which it seems to me it can
be done effectively in the traditional ways.  [I'll try to provide that
for Singularity itself; there should be something like man pages
available locally, or more extensive help, that corresponds to the
version that you have, not just live web pages.]  A container can have
help which is similar or identical to normal programs'.

This is the example I've been quoting as a useful demo of running a
Fedora 23 package (although the Debian one might have been better) that
I haven't ported to EPEL6, on which this is running.  It's the sort of
use I want to be able to make of something like Singularity if not a
good example for modularity and composition, but the idea is that it's
no different from any other executable.

  $ scilab -version
  Scilab version "5.5.2.1427793548"
  scilab-5.5.2

  $ scilab --help|head -5
  Usage:
  scilab <arguments>
  scilab-cli <arguments>
  scilab-adv-cli <arguments>

In that case the container doesn't have internal man, for instance, just
the Scilab help, but it could.

There could be a singularity method to print doc and/or /singularity
could look after that as above.
