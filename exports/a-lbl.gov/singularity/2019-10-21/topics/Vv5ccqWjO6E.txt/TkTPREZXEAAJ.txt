Tim, thankyou for the update.
This is not the place for me to comment on Julia, however I will and
apologise to anyone getting bored with this.
0.6 was supposed to be followed by 0.7 which had deprecation warnings.
Package owners were supposed to test with 0.7
Then 1.0 should have been introduced.
As you have seen significant packages are still to catch up.
We are promised failtfully that there will be no breaking cahnges in the
1.x series so here is hoping that things settle down.
