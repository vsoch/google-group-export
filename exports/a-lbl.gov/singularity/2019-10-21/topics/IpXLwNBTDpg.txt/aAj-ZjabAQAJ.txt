Hi Ryan,

1. Yes, we are aware that the EPEL version needs to be updated and Bennet
is working on that. Hopefully it will be updated with the release of 2.2.

2. Yes, bug and fixed but not in the 2.1.2 release. Sorry, my bad!

3. Because bind points occur as bind mounts, the target must be available.
So you will need to create ./HPCTMP_NOBKUP directory within the container.
The 2.2 release has a solution for this, but it only works on new'ish
kernels (e.g. RHEL7).

4. I've been considering that... And wondering how best to handle. I asked
some other projects if we could leverage their existing mailman
implementations, but was unable to secure an email list home. I am also
considering www.group.io. Does anyone have experience with them?

Thanks Ryan!

Greg
