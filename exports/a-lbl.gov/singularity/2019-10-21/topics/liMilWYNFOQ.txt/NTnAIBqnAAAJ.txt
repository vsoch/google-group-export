Hello Singularity users

Singularity 2.4.4 has just been released.  

This is a bug fix point release to the 2.4 feature branch. It removes the 
docker-extract functionality that was added in version 2.4.3. This feature 
added a new dependency and was subsequently found to increase the 
Singularity attack surface by unnecessarily linking the action-suid binary 
to libarchive, when compiled on specific Linux distributions.    

With sincere apologies to those who were looking forward to this bug fix. 
This feature will be re-implemented in a future release. Promise.

As always, please report any bugs to:
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/new
