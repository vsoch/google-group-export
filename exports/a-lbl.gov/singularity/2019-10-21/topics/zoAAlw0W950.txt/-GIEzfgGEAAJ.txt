That's what I'm not sure about. When you built off the directory, it
didn't add a the `/.singularity.d/` directory into the image.

And I _think_ that it builds similar if you use a tarball as the
source. So, if that's the case, there's not a metadata dir and it
would need to be included.

I saw the instructions to create a blank container and then you could "impo=
rt" a root filesystem stored as a .tar.gz. For some reason, I am not able t=
