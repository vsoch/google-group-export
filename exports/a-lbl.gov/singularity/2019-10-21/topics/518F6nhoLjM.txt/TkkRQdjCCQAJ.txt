It was decided that we weren't going to support systems that do not
support the NO_NEW_PRIVS flag. So for us, we fail during the configure
stage when trying to build. Now, if someone builds a binary, then
tries to run it on a host that doesn't support it, we fail with the
runtime check as well.

As the upstream, we're saying "We don't support this" -- both during
configure and run. We don't see it as an optional check, but a
mandatory one that must pass. But that is coming from *us*, what we
think. We think that having the check for PR_(S|G)ET_NO_NEW_PRIVS is
important enough to fail the configure stage if the test for it fails.

And that's Gentoo. We aren't distro package maintainers, and each
distro has their own way of handling things. What we're providing is
what *we* think should be done... no one else. We threw in the towel
on trying to securely support systems that don't support NO_NEW_PRIVS.
And so to enforce this we put in checks to cause Singularity to fail
to execute a container *and* during the configure stage on the systems
that are no longer supported. For us, as the maintainer, it makes
sense to fail at both configure and runtime on these systems.

You can patch it how you see fit for your use case, nothing is
stopping you from doing so. But we aren't going to change what we
provide without an overriding reason to do so. We made the decision to
make it a fatal error during configuration to be sure that people
understood that this wasn't supported anymore. Not everyone uses a
distro provided package when installing. If you want to support
_building_ on hosts that don't support the NO_NEW_PRIVS flag, you can
rip out the configure.ac check and that will leave you with only the
runtime check in place, and it's your option to do so.

That's not to say we can't come back to this and discuss it, and if
things change then we could modify how we handle it. But at this
moment, for us, it is an important enough flag we feel needs to exists
that we want to fail if we don't see it. At *both* configure and
runtime.
