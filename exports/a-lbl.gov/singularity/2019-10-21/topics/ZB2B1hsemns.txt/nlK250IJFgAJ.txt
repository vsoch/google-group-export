 Registration Open!

Since I first created Singularity, there has been interest in a formal
gathering, and I'm very excited the time has finally come. In collaboration
with San Diego Supercomputing Center and on behalf of Sylabs and the
Singularity development team, I want to invite everyone to be part of this
event.

We don't have a huge venue, so there will be limited attendance. As Erin's
message above states, we have opened the CFP and would be very excited to
have talks from system administrators, user services engineers, and users
of Singularity. We would love to hear about what people are doing with
Singularity, host some special interest panel discussions, integrations,
file system support, feature discussions, and there are more suggestions
listed at:

https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/sug2019/839030/

Submissions don't have to be long. Just a simple title and paragraph on
what you would like to discuss. Very informal, and we will respond if we
need more information.

Coupling the uptake of Singularity, all of the fantastic users and
use-cases world wide, integration of AI and new forms of compute based
workloads, and lastly the event sponsors, I can surely guarantee already
that this will be a fantastic event!

Lastly, registration for attendees is now open. We are going to be posting
this to various media and publications shortly, so this is an "early bird"
notification to our community of users. So if you are interested, make sure
you register ASAP to ensure your spot.

Looking forward to seeing you there and please let us know if you have any
questions.

Greg
