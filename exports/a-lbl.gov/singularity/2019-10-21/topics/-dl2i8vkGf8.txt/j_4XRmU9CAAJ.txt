Hi Taras,

There are a number of reasons why runC will not work on my shared
multi-tenant environments:

- requires root to run (there is however a submitted patch to allow
non-root, but it has not been accepted at this point)
- even with the proposed patch, no mitigation of user escalation within the
container
- the container files themselves are owned by root, thus a user can not
"bring their own environment"
- no facility or optimizations for MPI or parallel job launch
- requires a very recent host operating system (RHEL7 and compats, and
similar vintage Debian derivatives)
- no automatic control of which namespaces to use (e.g. automatic disable
PID namespace separation for OMPI shared memory optimizations)
- it is not a "mobility of compute" solution (it is an example
implementation of the OCI)

Singularity on the other hand addresses these issues and more:

- Because Singularity uses a single file for the container, that single
file can be owned by a user but contain root owned files inside (thus a
user can copy from another system)
- Single file also optimizes parallel runs with lots of open()s (large
python runs can take 10-30 minutes to start on a big system, but not in a
container image)
- Designed for: mobility/portability, speed, HPC, application
virtualization (running apps within the container as if they are running on
the host)
- Works on all currently maintained vintages of Linux (e.g. RHEL 5 and
compats)
- No limitations on vintage of Container OS (e.g. I have a 17 year old
install (RHL8) running in a Singularity image)

I think there are a number more, but this should frame some of the primary
bits. Anybody else have any differentiators of runC and Singularity?

This might make a great FAQ entry! I will work on that...

Greg
