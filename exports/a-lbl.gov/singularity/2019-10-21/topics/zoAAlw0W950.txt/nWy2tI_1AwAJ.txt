This has been tremendously helpful. Thank you.

Given how we're doing things with Singularity 2.5, will this still be 
possible for Singularity 3.0? I see there will be an entirely new image 
format:

https://www.sylabs.io/2018/08/a-glimpse-into-singularity-3-0/

Effectively, can we still create images out of "Sandboxes"?

Thanks,
Jai

i,
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 Well ... in this case singularity is beating out wwmkchroot it s=
ome
<br>ways. ;) =C2=A0For example you can do something like:
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 # cd /var/chroots
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 # singularity build --sandbox centos7-base docker://cento=

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 # singularity shell -w --sandbox centos7-base/
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 [ ... add packages, etc... ]
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 And have a functional root. Or you can setup a Singularity DEF f=
ile
<br>to build out a root. You can then do: =C2=A0wwvnfs
<br>--chroot=3D/var/chroots/centos7-<wbr>base --name=3Dcentos7-base =C2=A0.=
.. and have a
<br>&quot;functional&quot; VNFS built for warewulf. And since it was built =
initially
<br>with singularity, it would have the /.singularity.d directory
<br>included. Singularity is giving more functionality in a lot of cases
<br>that wwmkchroot currently has.
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 That&#39;s the biggest issue that I see.... Singularity takes a
<br>directory, or tarball, _as is_ and just adds it into a squashfs image.
<br>It doesn&#39;t add the metadata directory in with these. From what I ca=
n
<br>tell, the reason came down to a workflow like:
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 # singularity build --sandbox centos docker://centos:6
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 # singularity build centos6.img centos/
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 So, you _start_ with a sandbox directory, which has the
<br>/.singularity.d ... and you make an image from that. From what I see
<br>that was the expected work flow, and why it doesn&#39;t try adding the
<br>environment in when creating from a directory.

uldn&#39;t I make these host system libs available w/in the container manua=
lly by using a bind flag?
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The most concerning is the &quot;action=
&quot; commands. We definitely want the ability to call singularity exec &l=
t;command&gt; /image/to/vnfs/image. So far this seems to be working for us,=
 but it&#39;s not clear if there will be any side effects.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It seems like these scripts wouldn&#39;=
t be too hard to replicate, though, from what you write. I could create the=
m manually, I suppose. One thing we&#39;ve thought about doing was adding t=
o Singularity a &quot;singularity from vnfs&quot; feature that would proper=
ly invoke the metadata creation functionality.

<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Basically, we have different warewu=
lf vnfs OS images and we want to create a containers based on these images.=
 The distro isn&#39;t available on something like Dockerhub, so pulling fro=
m Dockerhub or Singularity hub isn&#39;t possible. A warewulf vnfs is basic=
ally something you can chroot too, so I would think it should be possible t=
o package that up into a container, either a singularity container or a doc=
ker container.
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have previously treated this chro=
otable vnfs as a singularity &quot;sandbox&quot; and ran the conversion too=
ls (I can successfully do a singularity shell /path/to/vnfs), but it wasn&#=
39;t clear to me if there were any drawbacks to this, as the fake &quot;san=
dbox&quot; doesn&#39;t have any of the singularity metadata in it. Will thi=
s be a problem?
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jai
