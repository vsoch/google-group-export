Singularity doesn't prevent you from running bootstrap twice - you can do
so at your own risk. For more reproducible containers, it's recommended to
do it once. Your error happens because a file exists from the first. If you
want this to work, you can write the logic in bash to check for the file,
and only perform the operation given that it doesn't exist (eg, this is
something I commonly do when trying to make directories). What would be a
very challenging feat is to implement something that could have assurance
about which commands the user has already done in some other run, without
breaking reproducibility and/or going into a more Docker-like strategy of
having to take a content hash of the contents of the command, saving the
layer, and then doing that check. Your ideas on how to do this, or a PR,
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
