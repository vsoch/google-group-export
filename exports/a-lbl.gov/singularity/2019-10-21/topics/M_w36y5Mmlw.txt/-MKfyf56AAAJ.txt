[Why, oh why do we have to use JavaScript to view text?]

* One obvious question is "why the name?".  To me it might mean
  mathematical ill-behaviour or something that may always be hidden by
  cosmic censorship.

* I don't know if it makes sense to compare with Snappy and Flatpak
  packaging.

* If it's actually possible simply to import a Docker image, maybe say
  so in the Docker or Shifter items?  Another important point about
  Docker in HPC is that the containers are not launched by the resource
  manager, so it can't directly manage them.

* I'd be inclined to mention somewhere the difference between
  "containers" as application packaging and operating system containers
  of old (zones, jails, WPARs, maybe OpenVz/LXC...).
