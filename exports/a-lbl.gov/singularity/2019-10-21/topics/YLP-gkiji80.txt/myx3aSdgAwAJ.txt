Doh - should have done a bit more google searching before last reply. 
There's a Red Hat bugzilla entry that looks like it is closely related to 
this panic:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383739

Stack trace for XFS is very similar here. That issue (if its the cause 
here) was fixed in 7.4.
