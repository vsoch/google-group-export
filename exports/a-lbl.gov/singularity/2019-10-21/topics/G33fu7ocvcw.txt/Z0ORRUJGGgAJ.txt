Hello there, wondering if this affects Singularity as well (I would say no, 
as this is Docker related but they mention cri-o as well which I guess it 
is included on S version 3.1.0... could be possible I'm completely wrong 
and I'm mixing apples with plantains... for the ones looking green):

*CVE-2019-5736: runc container breakout (all versions)*
...runc (the underlying container runtime underneath Docker, *cri-o*, 
containerd, Kubernetes, and so on)...
