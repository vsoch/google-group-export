Hi everyone,

this sounds like a trivial thing but I can't find or think of a reasonable 
solution.

I use "singularity pull" to create a sif file of a Dockerhub container:
$ singularity pull docker://asfdaac/s1tbx-rtc

Then run something in that container, possibly with many jobs:
$ singularity exec --bind `pwd`/output:/output s1tbx-rtc_latest.sif \
    python3 -u /work/rtc.py \
    --username $EOSDISLOGIN \
    --password $EOSDISPASSWORD \
    --granule $@

Pulling the container and building the sif file takes time, so, I'd rather 
not do that every time the container is run, but, I do want to ensure that 
I am always running the latest version of the container.

So, I'd like to have a script to check if the Dockerhub container is newer 
than what's in the sif file, and if it is, pull it again.

I could run "docker inspect -f '{{.Created}}' asfdaac/s1tbx-rtc", but that 
presumes that I have Docker installed (which we don't on our HPC machines), 
and it still requires to pull the Docker image. Any tricks on that so that 
one can inspect the container right on Dockerhub?

To check the Docker container version in the previously pulled sif file, I 
would have to somewhat encode the Docker container's Created tag into the 
sif container. Is there any way to do that? I am not seeing that as a pull 
option.

I guess I could always just chance it, check the mtime of the sif file and 
if it's older than say a day, or a week, pull it again, which I may end up 
doing if there's not a clean way to do what I am describing above.

Thanks,
MC
