Subject: Re: [Singularity] Creating a container from a vnfs?

Hi Jai,

  It depends on your needs. You'll have a very bare bones environment,
but you can do things like:

    singularity exec /path/to/vnfs cat /etc/os-release

  Singularity will throw a warning about not having helper scripts
(contained in /.singularity.d), but it calls the CLI arguments
directly. i.e. `cat` in this case.

  Same with running shell ... you'll have a pretty bare environment,
and singularity will call /bin/sh directly instead of the normal
helper script.

  So... a Warewulf VNFS root works (and, uhh... was actually how the
"images" were made back in the early days with wwmkchroot ;) ). But
depending on your needs it may not have everything to function how you
want. The entire `/.singularity.d` structure shell scripts, so you
_could_ replicate it pretty easily. The structure is described here:

    https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6.0/user-guide/environment_and_metadata.=
html#container-metadata

  Creating a basic image from something like:  `singularity build
alpine.img docker://alpine:latest`   ....  Would give you enough of
the structure to work with. You'd want to watch out for
`/.singularity.d/env/10-docker.sh` as that comes from the docker
manifest, but beyond that the scripts are pretty straight forward on
their function.

 Will this be a problem?
