Thanks Vanessa!

Does it work natively in GitHub actions, or just locally with popper?=20


It does not work on Github's platform, mainly because they don't give the=
=20
sufficient permissions, as you mentioned. However, Popper can be used to=20
run Github Actions workflows on CI services (we have a blog on how to do=20
that=20

yeah! We really like github actions as a workflow tool, hence our decision=
=20
of using it as the basis for Popper.

So TLDR thank you!=20


Thanks! We are working on more examples using Singularity-based actions; we=
=20
will share those once we have them ready.

cheers!
