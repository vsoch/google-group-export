Hi Vanessa, 

many thanks for the explanations!

> *SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHDIR *addresses the issue of being able to write at runtime to local directories. Read the rationale here: https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/604#issuecomment-294379830
Understood! I did now also do some tests. 

Running:
SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$(pwd)/tmp SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/cache singularity -vvv build  fos.img minimal.def
(with "minimal.def" boostrapping from Docker).

I observe the following:
$(pwd)/tmp/.singularity-build.NbsdAx
is created during build, holding the container root, as expected. This is temporary and removed afterwards, all fine :-). 

Additionally:
$(pwd)/cache/docker
contains the tarballs from the Docker layers, and is kept persistent. Also perfectly fine :-). 

However, the communication file:
/tmp/.singularity-layers.GMwGRqyD
is shortly present in "/tmp". This location seems to be hardcoded (see https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/2.4/libexec/handlers/image-docker.sh#L27 ),
but since that just seems to contain the list of layers, that's not really an issue (would be nice though if SINGULARITY_TMPDIR would be honoured). 

So all in all, it seems to really work as expected - at first I misidentified the "/tmp/.singularity-layers.GMwGRqyD" as being something like the extracted layers, I did not look closely enough ;-). 


So after this is all clear, my request would still be to document at least these two variables (and maybe more?) in the frame of "singularity build",
since they are essential to set up build hosts (for example, we will now put an extra partition with several GB in our VM to contain SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR to reduce the load on DockerHub). 
If we would use the SquashFS-images, we would also set SINGULARITY_TMPDIR to some ramdisk location to speed up the build tremendously (now we do that with --sandbox in any case). 

Should I file an issue for these doc updates, so you can do it at any most convenient time slot? 

> Yeah, we're terrible programmers. But it's getting better, everyone is working hard! Please submit a PR and make it right! Your contribution is greatly appreciated!
I think part of that is also this funny effect that when reading foreign code (and singularity code is foreign to me) you always get the feeling you are reading something badly programmed ;-). 
This also holds for your own code if you let it alone for a few years, I experienced this myself often enough ;-). 
At the current point of my life, I'm on the "operations" team, though, so I have only very limited time for PRs, but if I find time, I'll surely invest it! :-)

Cheers and all the best, 
Oliver
