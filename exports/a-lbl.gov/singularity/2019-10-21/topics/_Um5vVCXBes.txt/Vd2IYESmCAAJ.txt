To answer your question better:

Yes, you can let unprivileged users run singularity containers.
For that to work, however, you need to have sexec-suid have equipped with 
the suid bit and have allow setuid = yes enabled in singularity.conf.
I believe without that there is no chance since namespaces are broken.
