Thanks for the reply Jason. I tried changing things with setcap and it 
didn't help. I also tried 

$ chmod 777 /usr/bin/fusermount 
$ chown user:user /usr/bin/fusermount

Just to see what would happen and it still didn't help. Though like I said 
before, it works fine on my machine outside of a container, where:

$ ls -l /usr/bin/fusermount
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 32008 Apr 11 01:12 /usr/bin/fusermount

 which leads me to believe the problem is something about the singularity 
container, and not a fundamental limitation of trying to mount as a regular 
user. Any other ideas?
