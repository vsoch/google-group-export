That gave the path as:

/opt/scipy/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/opt/sdsc/lib:/opt/sdsc/lib/python2.6/site-packages

But /opt in the image is empty. So it is picking up the path from the host 
then.

When I echo $PATH it is different from that of the host. Is there somewhere 
these behaviors are listed? 

Thanks!
