Hi Harry,

Sorry for the late response... I've had a good share of meetings all
morning, but I've escaped for an hour or so! LOL

You did get the path to Exec worked out, which is good but I am going to
offer another solution below that I'm hoping will solve both issues.

The error you got during build was because Singularity did not have access
to all of the files in your host machine's /tmp thus the build failed.

Regarding /tmp... As you discovered it is not included by default.
Additionally, I need to create a few more sections (e.g. %build, %prep,
%install) which will allow additional customization when creating a
container. But, until then... Here is another example of a specfile that I
think will give you another way of doing this.


Name: tacg
Summary: test package

%files
/home/hjm/tacg/tacg /usr/bin/
/usr/local/lib/tacg/codon.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/matrix.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/rebase.dam+dcm.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/rebase.dam.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/rebase.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/rebase.dcm.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/regex.data
/usr/local/lib/tacg/rules.data

%runscript
if ! test -d /tmp; then
    mkdir /tmp
fi
/usr/bin/tacg "$@"


Typically the Exec directive will autopopulate the runscript, but in this
case we are going to specify it manually and add the creation of /tmp if it
is not present. Also, in the %files section, I am installing tacg into the
directory /usr/bin/ by use of the second argument in that line (use of the
second argument must ALWAYS be a directory name, and not a full path to the
executable!).

Let me know if that helps!
