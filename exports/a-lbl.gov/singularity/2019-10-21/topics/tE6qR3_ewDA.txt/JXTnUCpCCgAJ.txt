Hi Grigory,

I wanted to circle back with you on this, and see if you made any progress.
I have added a bunch of features that will help you in debugging:

$ singularity strace [container name] (arguments)
$ singularity shell [container name]

Also, you can increasing the default debugging tools included within the
container by adding this to your specfile (and rebuilding/reinstalling the
new SAPP):

DebugOS: [0-3] (default is 1, and most debugging tools at present if 3)

Another thing I thought of would be if MOPAC could take the file from STDIN
rather then from a path to a file. If you can't get the file path to work
properly (because MOPAC seems to rewrite the path to the file starting with
'/'), you might be able to use methods to pipe the data in.

Lastly, I have also added a basic test script that I will run before
committing to make sure that what I break with every fix! LOL

Hope that helps, and let me know!

Greg
