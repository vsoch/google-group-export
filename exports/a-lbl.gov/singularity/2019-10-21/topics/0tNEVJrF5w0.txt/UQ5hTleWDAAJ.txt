Hi Balazs,

Try "InstallFile" (not plural) for each line.

Yes, you *should be* able to use the InstallFile instead of %files section
as v1 had,... BUT.... v2 does not do any dependency resolution on those
files. There are two options... The first is to use image bootstrapping
system in v2 to ensure that the dependencies are present, orrrrr... We
could in theory pull back some of the v1 dependency resolution components
and use them within v2 during bootstrapping.

Thoughts?
