Hi All,
I noticed that in 2.1.2 there seems to be an extra requirement on 
singularity.conf ownership that was not present in version 2.0:
==========
$ singularity shell /software/src/singularity_images/sl7.img
ERROR  : Configuration file is not owned by root: 
/software/singularity-2.1.2-el6-x86_64/etc/singularity/singularity.conf
==========
Is this intentional?
Thank you,
Igor
