Hi All,

We have been supporting docker and singularity containerization to deliver 
our software. We were using persistent overlay on an ext3 img format to 
create some scratch space needed by our software that we did not want to 
expose to the user. A wrapper script would take care of mounting user 
volumes and overlaying the ext3 img over the simg in version 2.6.1. No sudo 
was required for creating the writable scratch space.

With singularity 3.x I could not figure out a way to create a scratch space 
(such as ext3 or even a directory) and overlay without root permissions. Is 
there any possibility to use --overlay without sudo or how can I create 
some scratch space that is not easily visible as directories and files to 
the user of our software?

Thank you for all your help and please let me know if something is not 
clear. I understand that this is not aligned with singularity principles of 
immutable container images, but as a software vendor, I need to make sure 
that some parts of the software which are generated at runtime are as hard 
to access as possible.
