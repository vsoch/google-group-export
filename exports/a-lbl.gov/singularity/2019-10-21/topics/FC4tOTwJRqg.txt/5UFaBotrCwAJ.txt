I see, it is more an issue with trusting the building process, which at
this point is difficult to ensure.

The motivation behind it was to involve the community providing the
resources and make Singularity Hub even better, so small teams don't have
to invest time on setting up the whole workflow because they hit the limit
when building images.

Cheers.
