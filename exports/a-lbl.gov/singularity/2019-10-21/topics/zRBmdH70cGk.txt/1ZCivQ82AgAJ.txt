Hi,

just wanted to give a quick feedback on this issue.

The javascript meteor-app that I wanted to include in the singularity 
container was on GitHub in development mode. 
And, meteor development mode is not suited to be deployed in a container. 
What I needed to do was to package the
app and run it as a node.js app which made it necessary to install a 
mongo-db server. Both the mongo-db server and 
the node.js app can easily be started from userspace. 

The other problem seems to be related to the fact that our home directories 
on the cluster are placed on a mounted filesystem.
And apparently, singularity quits when it can't mount the home directory 
before it binds the directories specified in the -B flag. I circumvented
this by specifying a home directory on the local filesystem with the -H 
flag. I think the admin could also just have disabled the automounting of
the home directory in the singularity configuration file. 

So, all after all the app is running now in the singularity container on 
the cluster. Great. Thank you for singularity.
