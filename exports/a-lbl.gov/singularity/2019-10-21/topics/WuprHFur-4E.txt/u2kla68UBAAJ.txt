Personally, I prefer that the host environment is sanitized before starting 
the build process.

My question would be, what are you looking for in your environment that 
can't be determined by some other means in %setup or in %post?
What you're describing is not scripting the generation of the container as 
much as scripting the generation of the definition file.

At that point you could have a Singularity definition file template and 
have bits filled in depending on whatever factors you want.

If you can determine what you want during %setup using other factors you 
can always set a variable to work during %post, for example:

BootStrap: docker
From: alpine:latest

%setup
 echo $HELLOWORLD
 echo "HELLOWORLD='Hello there'" >> 
$SINGULARITY_ROOTFS$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT

%post
  source $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT
  echo $HELLOWORLD
  rm $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT

%runscript
  exec echo $HELLOWORLD

If you have it in your environment the first $HELLOWORLD is stripped which 
is expected. Next you can use any logic you want to determine and set an 
env variable for %post, you can use it in %post and delete it afterwards if 
you want.

When actually running the container you can set SINGULARITYENV_HELLOWORLD 
on the host and the container will read it when you run it.

Although, to your point, it'd be interesting if SINGULARITYENV_anything 
wasn't stripped at build time... I can already think of other possible uses.
