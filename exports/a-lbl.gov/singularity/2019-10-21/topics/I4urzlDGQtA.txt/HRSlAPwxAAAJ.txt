Hi Paulo,

What we meant by "native" is that you don't need to do anything additional
to support GPU. For example...

Singularity (now in development branch) supports the `--nv` flag which will
find the relevant Nvidia/Cuda libraries on your host via the ld.so.cache,
and will bind those into a library location within the container
automatically. It will also make sure those libraries are linked, as
necessary, by any Cuda applications that require it. Additionally, with the
device tree bound into the container, all of the components for appropriate
application runtime support are present, and as has been tested, it just
works. :)

At the time of developing that table, no other container runtimes provided
native, internal, out of the box support for GPUs.

Hope that helps!

Greg
