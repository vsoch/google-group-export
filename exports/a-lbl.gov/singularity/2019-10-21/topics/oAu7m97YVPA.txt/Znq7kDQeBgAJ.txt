Hi all,

I think I can answer my own questions and say 'yes'.  But it's really 
strange to me, so I want to confirm my understanding.

I created a singularity image on virtualbox which has CentOS 7 installed.  
I then transferred that container to another computer which had a CentOS 6 
build.  I ran it without problem.  I've read multiple times that both 
Docker and Singularity require that the host kernel is being used both 
inside and outside the container.

This suggests to me that a very new CentOS build can run in a very old 
Linux Kernel.  Is that correct?  Can I assume that everything "just 
works"?  It's just strange to think that there is both forward and backward 
compatibility between OS and kernel.

Along those same lines, I understand that each OS (RedHat, Ubuntu) make 
customizations to the "official" Linux kernel.  Yet, I can create a 
Singularity Ubuntu image on a RedHat host.  Again, is it safe to assume 
that things just work?

Thanks for help with this theoretically point I'm stuck on.


Robert
