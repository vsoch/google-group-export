Hi folks,

I thought based on the docs (e.g. http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-recipes) 
this was the default behavior but I had a build complete when in fact there 
was an error in %files as shown in this build log excerpt:

Adding files to container
Copying 'build/ojdbc6.jar' to '/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/lib/'
/bin/cp: cannot create regular file 
'/usr/local/singularity/var/singularity/mnt/container//usr/lib/jvm/default-java/lib/': 
No such file or directory
ESC[31mERROR: Failed copying file(s) into container
ESC(BESC[mRunning post scriptlet

I know the error happens because the directory doesn't exist because %files 
is done before %post and java is installed in %post. But anyway why did the 
build continue to run %post and finish the image when a command in %files 
failed?

Thanks,

Tim
