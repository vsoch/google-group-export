Hi Thomas,

The short version... Yes, but not now. hah

I have network namespace support planned for 2.4 (keep in mind we are just
trying to get 2.3 stabilized for release) so it will be a bit before you
will be able to do that. Stay tuned though, because as we approach that,
questions will certainly come up where I/we will want feedback on use-cases.

Thanks and great thinking!

Greg
