That's exactly what I was aiming at. What I want to do is to use a docker image to build my application. With different docker images I can use different compilers, libraries, etc. Once the resulting binary is available I would like to pack this binary and the libraries it depends on in a singularly container. Not the compiler, nothing extra just the binary and the libraries. I think that the article was based in singularity 1.x.
