Again a bit of a shameless plug, here's our MPI container recipe: 
https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/Singularity-ubuntu-mpi. We run CentOS7 on the 
host, and the container runs Ubuntu16. 

The InfiniBand stack is brought in from the Ubuntu repos. Notice that I am 
lazy to build too much stuff inside of the container so I am bringing the 
Intel compiler and the MPI from the host (on an NFS mounted file system).

I haven't done an extensive testing on this with real applications but I 
have one on todo list once things calm down a bit. 

HTH,
MC
