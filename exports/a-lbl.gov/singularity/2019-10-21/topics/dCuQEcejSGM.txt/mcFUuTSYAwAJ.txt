Not really. The docker image that I use for building might be very large since it needs to have the entire build environment. The image that just contains the executable might be much smaller in size. Docker hub is not an option since the images might contain libraries/tools that I cannot upload to a service like docker hub. But there are solutions for a kind of self-hosted non-publi docker hub alternative.
