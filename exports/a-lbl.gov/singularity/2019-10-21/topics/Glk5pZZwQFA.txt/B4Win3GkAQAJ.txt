we are hosting a competition that supports execution of different types of 
scripts - python2/3, java, julia, ..so on - at least a dozen or more. there 
are certain packages that have licensing issues.
we have been thinking of installing applications on the host machine and 
then isolating competitor script to isolate them from the environment for 
security purposes. better to have a dozen+ containers?


thanks
