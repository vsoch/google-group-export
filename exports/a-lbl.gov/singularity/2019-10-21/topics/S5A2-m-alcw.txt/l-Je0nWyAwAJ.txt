Hi Sven,

Sadly I don't know any way to get more info from the debootstrap process,
but
I don't think its the debootstrap which is causing your problem (although I
agree that it looks like that from you're logs). I wonder if its possible
something in your runscript/post sections is modifying things that were
setup by debootstrap?

My containers typically use a %post section. I've never had a problem
rerunning debootstrap EXCEPT when my %post section contains something like
a mkdir which has already executed once.

I'd suggest trying to remove all post/runscript sections first first,
creating a minimal container, confirming that debootstrap will work
multiple times. Alternatively, perhaps you wish to share your def file on a
github gist and see if anyone else can reproduce?

On a related note, if you want to write code that is robust against
repeated runs, I suggest looking at ansible to contain that code. A def
file that does an apt install ansible, git clone, and ansible-playbook
would be perfectly valid. However like Vanessa I would caution against this
approach because running debootstrap (containers build for production
should work reliably from the def file first time every time, ansible
shouldn't be necessary). OTOH if you want to deploy the same environment to
VMs, containers and bare metal, its a good approach. You could also use it
in "container development" fixing problems one at a time, but keep it in
dev not prod ;-)

Cheers,
--
Chris.
