This repository is a great idea and docker2singularity from Vanessa is very
interesting.

Now, just a word about the 50MB github limitations. I think you would need
your own hosted project using something like git-fat (
https://github.com/jedbrown/git-fat ) (inside gitlab forge ?) or even a
more basic http/ftp storage (perhaps using some big files download process
torrent/aspera (...) :
http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Moving-Your-Data-It-s-Not-Always=
-Pleasant
). Now, you just have to find the storage server :)

Best regards,
