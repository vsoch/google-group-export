If you "only" need the pull functionality, you could use 
https://github.com/olifre/dockerhub2oci
It's basic, but it works for me, runs completely unprivileged, has few dependencies, is just a readable shell script,
and handles whiteout. If you find bugs, blame me ;-). 

If you need more, you could look at other, more advanced tooling such as: 
https://github.com/projectatomic/skopeo
or
https://github.com/jessfraz/img
I have not used any of these yet, but they also perform image operations unprivileged. 

It's also extremely unclear to me why the issue of needlessly linking libarchive to action-suid mentioned in the news message (which reads like a press release...)
can not just be resolved in the build system without pulling out the full feature. 
Since I am only used to modern build systems (waf, cmake etc.) and have no experience with relicts such as automake which is usually not used for new developments
(why would one do that?), I can't offer help with that. 

Cheers,
	Oliver

As a temporary fix, several git commits will be reverted, and a new 2.4.4 release will be created.  This release will still include the remaining bug and security fixes from the 2.4.3 release. The docker-extract functionality will be re-implemented in a new version (tentatively 2.5) in a manner that will avoid the issue. We sincerely apologize for the confusion and inconvenience.  Thank you for your patience.

>                 It may be possible for a malicious user to keep a directory open pointing to anything on the host filesystem within a container in such a manner that would bypass the security precautions already in place. Hosts that do not support the `prctl()` function `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` are at risk. Most current distributions of Linux support this feature (e.g. RHEL6 with kernels newer then 2.6.32-504.16.2), and it is recommended to update to the latest upstream distribution release if you can.
