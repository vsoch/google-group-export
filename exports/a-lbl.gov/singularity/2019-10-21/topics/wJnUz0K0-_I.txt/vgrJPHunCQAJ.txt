<br>
I hav a requirement to install a local singularity hub portal for local off=
ice internal use only.=C2=A0 I have installed one to a host on the local la=
n, eg:<a href=3D"http://shub.local.net" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">=
http://shub.local.net</a>=C2=A0 I can login into it via twitter auth, creat=
e users and the rest of the web ui works ok.=C2=A0 I just cannot get a clie=
nt to push an image up to a collection.. I have gone through the documentat=
ion online and i must have missed something or not understood something, bu=
t when i run sregistry from the singularity-pyhon option, I get a KeyError:=
&#39;username&#39;<br>
<br>
any ideas anyone? or recommended simplest method to allow for users to push=
 singularity images into the internal singularity hub?<br>
<br>
Or maybe i am reading the wrong client info?<br>
<br>
any advice on getting an internal hub configured would be much appreciated<=
