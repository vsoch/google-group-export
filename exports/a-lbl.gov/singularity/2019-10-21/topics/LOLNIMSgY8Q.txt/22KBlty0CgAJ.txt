Trying to use singularity on Nimbix, an HPC cloud provider, I get the error 
mentioned in the title. 

The way I have been trying to use singularity is that after starting a job 
in the cloud I can log in using ssh. The OS is  Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS - old, I 
know. In the ssh environment I can use sudo, so I can compile singularity - 
I am using 2.5.2 (I am more familiar with v2 and also it is easier to 
install). The install goes OK, but when trying to run a container session I 
get 

singularity shell --nv tf_1.13.1-gpu
ERROR  : Could not make mountspaces slave: Permission denied
ABORT  : Retval = 255

What exactly is the problem? This is a permission issue - so is this 
something I can fix using sudo? Or is the OS too old to support 
singularity? Or is the cloud environment too limited to allow singularity 
execution?

Thanks for help.
