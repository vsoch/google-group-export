Hi,

That=E2=80=99s concerning. I=E2=80=99m not sure about this devpts issue - s=
omeone else may chip in there.

R.E. things in $HOME - it wouldn=E2=80=99t be virtualenvs I=E2=80=99d expec=
t to cause issues, but instead things in `.local/lib/pythonx.x` - if $HOME =
is in the container python is going to see that and could load them, and th=
ey might be in conflict with stuff in the container.

Also - I=E2=80=99m not familiar with the puppet forge module for Singularit=
y - but it looks as though it has been appropriately updated to track any c=
hange in singularity.conf

I=E2=80=99m out of thoughts here really. It might be worth posting an issue=
 on the sregistry-cli GitHub site: https://github.com/singularityhub/sregis=
try-cli/issues <https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry-cli/issues>
