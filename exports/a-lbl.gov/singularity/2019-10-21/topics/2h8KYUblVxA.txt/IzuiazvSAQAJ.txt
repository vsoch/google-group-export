Dave, I was mistaken on our config being setuid = no, whew!  I'll have to 
pass along this information to our cluster owners to determine a course of 
action.

cat /nfs/system/singularity/singularity_2_4_4/singularity.conf | grep setuid
# Should we allow users to utilize the setuid program flow within 
Singularity?
allow setuid = yes

</span>&gt; The PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVSfeature was added to prctl()in the Linux=

&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
</span><span>&gt; If you find that your system does not properly support th=
is feature, you will need to either upgrade the operating system, upgrade t=
he kernel, or disable Singularity (set allow setuid =3D noin singularity.co=
nffile) and/or any other container runtime you may have installed pending a=
 kernel update.<br>
<br>
How does setting &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; &quot;disable Singularity&=
quot;? <br>
Again: If this is only affecting container runtimes needing setuid root, wh=
y should I disable others (e.g. charliecloud, runc&#39;s rootless container=
s,...)? <br>
How is PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS of any effect if there are no special privileges=
 involved? <br>
<br>
AFAIK, &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; for Singularity only disables the se=
tuid root based functionality, which many users actually do not need - last=
 time I checked it was only needed for OverlayFS and image file mounting,<b=
r>
which is to be considered unsafe anyways at least for a few years to follow=
 unless the container image source is fully trusted. &quot;limit container =

are very helpful here. <br>

<br>
Still, many thanks for the heads-up, but some more detailed information alo=
ng the lines of:<br>
- who exactly is affected (it&#39;s unclear if this only affects setuid roo=
t users, and if so, it surely affects only a small subset of available othe=

- how to mitigate until one can upgrade (again, you state &quot;disable Sin=

- CVE / background info links, if available, would have been nice. <br>
- which versions of singularity are affected in which configurations? <br>
