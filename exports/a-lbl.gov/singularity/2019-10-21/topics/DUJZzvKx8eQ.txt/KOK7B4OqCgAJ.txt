Sure thing. Invocation of unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) results in an error 22
(Invalid argument). The same system call works on other distros which
support user namespaces.

It is quite misleading:

$ grep CONFIG_USER_NS /boot/config-3.10.0-327.28.2.el7.x86_64
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
$ grep CLONE_NEWUSER /usr/include/linux/sched.h
#define CLONE_NEWUSER           0x10000000      /* New user namespace */


Is this a bug that should be reported upstream?
>

Nope, not according to this: (
http://rhelblog.redhat.com/2015/07/07/whats-next-for-containers-user-namespaces/)...
It was done on purpose:

"That said, Red Hat disabled them, because we think that user namespaces
need to incubate in the upstream community longer to fully understand the
security implications ..."

If you don't mind installing a Fedora kernel, it should work just fine as
the user space requirements seem present.
