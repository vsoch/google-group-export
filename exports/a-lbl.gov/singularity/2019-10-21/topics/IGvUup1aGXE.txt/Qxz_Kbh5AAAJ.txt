Subject: Re: [Singularity] Can a singularity container execute programs
 "outside" of the container?

But it should be ok to call sbatch on a job file within a container, no?
I'm thinking of a scenario where you want to pass around submission scripts
with a container of interest. For this use case it sounds like the job is
being submit from R (with rslurm) that the user wants to provide in a
container (and not install on the host) to still use the host sbatch.

As for what is being submit to run, that would likely be a script in the
container too, but care should be taken to ensure that the job launched
loads any singularity module, and then equivalently runs the container. So
something like:

0. have container with rslurm and some other analysis stuffs (in R?)
1. execute container on host --> uses rslurm to send jobs to *host* sbatch
2. job file that is executed again calls the container (and loads
singularity if necessary)
3. final thing is script in container running on host.

I think, given that the lab doesn't want to (and can) run the submission
step from the host, it would save the extra back and forth ness. But if the
submission itself also is part of the "reproducible pipeline" then it makes
sense for the container to also serve as a means to submit the job. What
you would want to do is to provide very detailed instructions for how to do
this. For example, the submission step (to slurm --> sbatch on host) might
be done with an exec command, but running the container call the end
executable. That way, a user that doesn't have a job manager (or just wants
to do the scientific thing) doesn't get confused if the container doesn't
work because it doesn't have this external dependency. Does that make sense?
