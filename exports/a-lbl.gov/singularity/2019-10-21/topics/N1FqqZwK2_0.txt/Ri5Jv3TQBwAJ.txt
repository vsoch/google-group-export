Hi chaps,


I am currently working on a distributed graph processing platform which 
maintains an Akka cluster inside of docker containers and have recently 
been granted access to a large cluster to test this. Unfortunetly, this 
cluster does not run docker, only singularity.


This did not initially seem an issue as singularity supports docker images, 
however, due to the nature of the Akka cluster, I have to past several 
environment variables and bind several ports. As an example, a 'Partition 
Manager' within the system would be run with the following command:


docker run -p $PM0Port:2551 --rm -e "HOST_IP=$IP" -e "HOST_PORT=$PM0Port" 
-v $entityLogs:/logs/entityLogs $Image partitionManager $PM0ID 
$NumberOfPartitions $ZooKeeper


From looking through the Singularity documentation I can see that I can 
create a 'Singularity' file and specify the environment variables, but 
there doesn't seem to be any documentation on binding custom ports. Nor 
does it explain how I could pass arguments to the default entrypoint (The 
project is compiled with 'sbt docker:publish' so I am not sure exactly 
where this would be to reassign it).


Even if this was the solution, as there are multiple actor types (and 
several instances of each) it appears specifying environment variables and 
ports in a document would require templating, creating the files at run 
time, and building an image for each individual actor.

I am sure I have completely missed a page somewhere which would nicely 
translate this docker command into the equivalent singularity, but I just 
can't find it. If anyone could point me to such a resource, or could help 
me convert this themselves, that would be fantastic!


All the best,

Ben
