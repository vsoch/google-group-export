Subject: Re: [Singularity] best way to convert a docker image to a SAPP

we could have a pre-made singularity docker image, and mount it inside the
docker container to package.
But the singularity installation could be incompatible with the target
docker OS.

Could we imagine the other way around ? I guess that singularty does not
need to be able to execute a target executale, it should be enough to
analyze it (ldd, parse etc...).
So suppose that you have a singularity docker image, then you mount the
target docker filesystem inside the singularity docker, then create the
sapp and export it to the host OS.
Is it feasible ?
