Speaking of container formats (images, directories, archives). I wonder if
it would be worthwhile looking into supporting OCI images:
https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec It has a growing support in
the container community (see
https://coreos.com/blog/oci-image-specification.html).

Best,
Chris
