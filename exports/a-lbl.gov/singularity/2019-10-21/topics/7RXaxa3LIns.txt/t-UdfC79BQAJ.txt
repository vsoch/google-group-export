Perhaps a stupid observation from me...
You will have to use something like VNC.
If you have multiple users on the same physical system, then how do you
identify the keyboards and mice?
An X server expects there to be physically connected keyboards and mice. So
how do you cope with multiple users?
The answer is X multiseat
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiseat_configuration
But really.. VNC seems the way to go here.

If I have misunderstood what you are trying to achieve then I apologise.
