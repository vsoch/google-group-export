Hi all,

I'm trying to follow along the Deployment Build wiki page 
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=singularity+hub+deployment+&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab&gfe_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=jKdzWoKJHqzHXvbqiAg> 
with one of my container repos, however I've having trouble getting builds 
triggered.

The repo I have (https://github.com/dl-container-registry/ffmpeg) is built 
with travis, which builds a docker image and then pushes to github. I've 
configured the repo with th "Github Auto Deployment" integration, added a 
personal access token generated from the developer settings in my account 
settings, environments is unset, and "Deploy on status" is ticked, the 
service is marked as "Active" so I believe it should be emitting 
*deployment* events when a build succeeds.

I have a single webhook, the one added by singularity hub when I added the 
repo: https://www.singularity-hub.org/hooks/build/push 
<https://github.com/dl-container-registry/ffmpeg/settings/hooks/21091992> 

*(deployment and push)*It appears that the Github Auto Deployment 
integration isn't triggering a deployment on successful build.


Does anyone have any pointers?

I'll happily update the wiki with more detail once I've managed to get my 
setup working.

Kind regards,
Will Price
