+1 what Dave said! If you want some getting started guides and tutorials
for SCIF, here is a good starting base --> https://sci-f.github.io. And if
you are ready to build your custom container with multiple entrypoints /
environments, etc. and just need a little help, please reach out to me and
I'd be glad to help out with your recipe.
