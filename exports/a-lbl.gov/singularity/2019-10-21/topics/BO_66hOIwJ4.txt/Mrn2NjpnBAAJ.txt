Yes! Both Flask and Django use jinja2 templates, so this means that the
visualization can be a quick command line tool or a HUB view. In both
cases, the utility is to see a single container, or differences /
similarities between two containers. Likely the two views (command line and
HUB) I'll make very similar, with minor tweaks to the HUB to have a better
user experience within the rest of the application. For the command line,
since it's serving a small local API, I can have a json view to return the
contents of any file within the container, and then use an ajax request to
load the file on the page when the user clicks it (without needing to
refresh the page). The main difference in usability is that from the HUB we
can't do anything with sudo, and since packaging currently requires it,
only users that upload packages will be able to do this,

Speaking of, is there a way to get lists of files and folders for a
container (not packaged) without sudo? That would make it possible to have
the visualization for all containers!
