This is something I am also pretty interested in! If there is any way you 
could keep me looped in for the conversation, I would be greatly 
appreciative. I am trying to set the lab I am in up for better reproducible 
research, in a similar way (i.e. submit a container with research, which 
can be used to reproduce results).
