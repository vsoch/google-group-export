Hi Dave,

The contest is open to everyone (https://ipc2018.bitbucket.io). Its 
about automated AI planning: given a model of the world, an initial 
situation and a goal condition, the programs have to find a sequence of 
actions that transform the initial situation into one that satisfies the 
goal condition.

I had a look at Singularity Hub before but it didn't seem like a good 
fit for us. A large number of our participants will use mercurial on 
bitbucket instead of github. We also want to run other tests on the 
generated images (we cannot use %test since the participants write the 
script). I tried converting a Mercurial repo to git and connected it to 
Singularity hub but didn't see any builds on the page showing "This page 
will refresh automatically with new builds" 
(https://singularity-hub.org/collections/288/). I didn't follow up on 
this so far because of the other reasons against Singularity Hub.

I'll have a look at VMs. Is this how Singularity Hub bootstraps the 
images internally? Can you recommend a specific setup, type of VM or 
something?

Cheers
Florian
