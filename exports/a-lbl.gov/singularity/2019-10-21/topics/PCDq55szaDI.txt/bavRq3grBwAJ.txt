If you are able to obtain the files via Github or standard webby requests
(wget / curl) in your recipe, it shouldn't be an issue. The primary
problems that people run into might be related to size (if your image is
bigger than the entire build server) and then needing very specific
requirements of the host. If you want to test, we can give the secure
builder a try (here
<https://github.com/cclerget/singularity/tree/feature-squashbuild-secbuild-2.5.0>)
or just try a build and see how it goes.

Haha sure thing! Yes, it's actually everything minus the build service. It
would give you the power to do whatever you want to make an image (e.g.,
build on your laptop) and then push to it (wherever it's hosted) and then
pull the images (still) with the Singularity software.

Ah, so the builders is the API that will do the build, on Google Cloud, and
to spit into a storage bucket! It's totally customizable so you could write
your own custom build routine (the default is a standard instance size,
choices, etc.). The plan has been to integrate these builders into
Singularity Registry as a plugin so you have all of the features of
Singularity Hub, we are just waiting on review for a different feature
(Globus) before we can do that. I am hopeful that happens soon! Haha.

Yeah! If "composing" means building with services, I would bet that
something is already in the world. The Sylabs guys can comment more on that!

Best,

Vanessa
