Thanks Eduardo. It does not tell me how to install other Julia packages. I 
used  Julia -e 'Pkg.add. ' in %post and it seems to work with exceptions.
I was able to find nlp.jl  and hence the package location (/root/.julia) 
through a "find" on the singularity sandbox. And then sed worked.

I am testing julia --version and julia -e 'Pkg.installed()' from 
%runscript. If I run into issues, I may need your help.

Thanks!
