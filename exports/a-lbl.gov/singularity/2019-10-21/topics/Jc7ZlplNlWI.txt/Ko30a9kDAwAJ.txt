On doing $PYTHONPATH, I get:

/bin/sh: 12: 
/opt/scipy/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/opt/sdsc/lib:/opt/sdsc/lib/python2.6/site-packages: 
not found

So is it looking in the host path when it says "not found"? That's what's 
confusing me: when is it looking at host directories and when in the image.

Thanks
Asif
