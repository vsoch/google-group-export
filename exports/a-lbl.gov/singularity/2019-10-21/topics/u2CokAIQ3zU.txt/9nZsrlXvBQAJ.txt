Just wanted to throw a suggestion and see if that helps. Try setting 'mount
home = no' and explicitly bind mount each of the filesystems that you need
to access inside the container. I did notice the 'mount home = yes' is
doing few things which is causing issues. I did not get a chance yet to
further investigate this and submit a proper github issue here. This might
not have anything to do with Panasas. Try this and see if it helps.

Good luck,
--Krishna.
