Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity Container Info for Workflows - in the header?

@greg: I feel pretty strongly that the workflow itself should be a separate
thing from the particular runs of it. Both are important, but the way I'm
envisioning singularity-hub is that is makes it possible to reproduce an
analysis, but the representation of inputs is on the level of {{file}} and
{{string}} and the hard coded data paths should not be tied to a workflow.
I completely agree that it should be possible to reproduce immediately a
workflow that is associated with some particular data, and we can have
methods /data structures etc to make that possible, however what is stored
in singularity hub should *just* be the workflow, agnostic to the data that
people want to run it with. Specifying data, especially with privacy
issues, etc, is a hairy problem. Ideally, there will be a "data grabber"
tool that has nice integration with S3, dropbox, or privately stored data,
and that data grabber will have easy integration to point to / plug into a
singularity hub workflow, so perhaps a researcher would just store a file
in a github repo somewhere that has a representation of both the data
grabbing step and the pointer to a specific workflow. I want users to be
able to re-use the same workflows, on different data, with perhaps some
option to upload  / return a standard representation of a result, but
again, tying a specific data input to a workflow means that people won't
re-use others workflows, and then we have the equivalent of Github today -
extreme redundancy with poor organization and re-use.

@tristan: It's not an issue of storing the output definition somewhere, but
getting it in the first place. Right now what seems best is along the lines
of what you are suggesting - having the user define it manually, and then
storing in some data structure. Boutiques might be best for this purpose -
in which case we would just keep the original json in the database, have
the user specify the outputs in an interface, and then update the structure
(and make it available also via the API).
