Subject: Re: [Singularity] singularity shell busybox.img: ERROR Could not set
 NO_NEW_PRIVS safeguard: Invalid argument
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hi Henrik,

PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS was backport into the RHEL6 kernel as a security
update in April 2015:

https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0864.html

If your kernel is missing that, there might be various missing
security updates.  My reading of the release notes for 6.6, it should
be in a general RHEL 6.6 kernel.  Perhaps contact your vendor?

The goal of singularity is that the user can never gain more host
privileges from inside the container than outside (in fact, if you
pass various options like "-C", the process inside has far less).  So,
there should be no way that the user can gain any super-user
privileges from running inside the container.

Brian
