Of course, for depth greater than two, you might have multiple ancestor 
runscripts:

/path/to/0/parent_runscript.sh  # this is the most recent
/path/to/1/parent_runscript.sh
/path/to/2/parent_runscript.sh

Then you should probably just call /path/to/0/parent_runscript.sh in most 
cases.

<span><br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Some remarks/clarifications:<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Currently there&#39;s no built-in limit on the depth of in=
heritance<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; but the deepest definition is considered the main parent.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This makes sense.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; While there is probably no use cases that would require recursion,<br>
&gt; why not support it from the get-go?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>Initially it was recursive but I put in a check to avoid infinite<br=
>
loops. This could easily be an option.<br>
<span><br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. The main parent&#39;s BootStrap, OSVersion, MirrorURL and =
UpdateURL<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; keywords take priority over all other definitions.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; We would want to explicitly walk people through different goals a=
nd<br>
&gt; &gt; use cases...<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This should be easy and I would submit that the order of the keywords<=
br>
&gt; should always take precedent (first will be used, and all others<br>
&gt; ignored). With that, if we use an Include statement above any other<br=
>
&gt; keywords, then the file that is being included will have keywords<br>
&gt; defined *above* the parent, and thus those will end up being parsed<br=
>
&gt; first.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>I think it&#39;s easy as long as the difference in behaviour between=
<br>
keywords and sections is clearly spelled out. Some<br>
guidelines/walkthroughs would definitely be needed. For example even if<br>
you could include a file in the middle of %post that should be avoided<br>
for clarity. Instead consider breaking up the definition.<br>
<span><br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. The Inherit keyword can contain multiple definitions, but =
the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; first definition will always be considered the parent or<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the one which leads to the parent. ie.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Inherit: def1 def2 def3<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; I didn&#39;t realize it until now, but I think we are indeed thinking =
of<br>
&gt; different features. In the vision that I have, you could have as many<=
br>
&gt; Include keywords as you want. All in order of how they would be<br>
&gt; included (again just like in C). For example:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Include: def1<br>
&gt; Include: def2<br>
&gt; Include: def3<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; With of course the first defined keyword taking priority.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But where I think this makes the most sense, is not in keywords... but=
<br>
&gt; rather section support. This yields the possibility of concatenating<b=
r>
&gt; alike sections together. I can see this being VERY useful for a use<br=
>
&gt; case like:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I distribute my awesome definition/recipe that builds a very specific<=
br>
&gt; workflow. Someone downloads this, and instead of modifying it, they<br=
>
&gt; include it in a definition that they have which is customized for a<br=
>
&gt; particular OS. So, this can be implemented in a manner of having a<br>
&gt; base Ubuntu bootstrap (that could either bootstrap from debootstrap<br=
>
&gt; or docker), and that gets included by another bootstrap definition<br>
&gt; that adds some scientific packages to it. And that one can be<br>
&gt; included by another that does something else.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>I tried this out earlier and it works both ways. I wasn&#39;t aware<=
br>
that singularity_keys_get handled multiple keywords like in your<br>
example.<br>
<span><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I never thought about the idea of allowing for multiple inherits<=
br>
&gt; &gt; (From) in one file, I&#39;m interested to hear what others think =
about<br>
&gt; &gt; this. My instinct is telling me if would lead to a lot more bugs,=
<br>
&gt; &gt; given that three different things are going into one image<br>
&gt; &gt; generation (what if one image has a bug? What if one software is<=
br>
&gt; &gt; reinstalled? not compatible? etc). There is something to be said<=
br>
&gt; &gt; for maintaining the standard that is known, the one that Docker h=
as<br>
&gt; &gt; been using, but I&#39;d be open to support for the other way.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you consider inherits being functionality equivalent as froms,<br>
&gt; then I would agree that this would lead to a lot more bugs as you<br>
&gt; would be layering in a manner that is not designed to be layered.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>How does the Docker From stop someone from pulling an image and<br>
then running something incompatible? Or creating a chain of dockerfiles<br>
with one of them containing a bug?<br>
<br>
Also Docker does have or had multiple Froms but it was proposed for<br>
removal as it wasn&#39;t well supported:<br>

&gt; &gt;&gt; def1 is the parent unless it inherits from other definitions =
as<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; well. 4. Packages from the Include keyword are concatenated.<=
br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; IncludePkgs? Hrmm... That would be tough. I don&#39;t think this shoul=
d<br>
&gt; change any configurations of an existing keyword.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>What about having multiple Include/IncludePkgs keywords?<br>
Either way a guideline for this would be to avoid putting<br>
packages which depend on some inheritance in this, instead do a manual<br>
yum install in %post.<br>
<span><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 5. Sections (runscript, post, test) are combined but this could<b=
r>
&gt; &gt;&gt; potentially be changed to create multiple posts or tests.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This also sounds messy. I like the idea of having &quot;modules&q=
uot; that<br>
&gt; &gt; could be added to the post section (so the same code isn&#39;t do=
ne<br>
&gt; &gt; over a million times) but I&#39;m not sure how this would work ea=
sily -<br>
&gt; &gt; some kind of template library? Then if the template changes, it&#=
39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; another thing to keep track of second to the image and it&#39;s s=
pec.<br>
&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t like this idea.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I actually don&#39;t think it is so bad if implemented correctly, and =
it<br>
&gt; is a use case that I actually need at LBNL. Is it more reasonable to<b=
r>
&gt; you under the explanation of &quot;include&quot; rather then &quot;fro=
m&quot;? In that<br>
&gt; case, for example, a %post would be executed from both recipes in the<=
br>
&gt; order that they were included.<br>
&gt;<br>
</span>Could the tracking of includes be optional?<br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 6. No docker bootstrap support at the moment.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We have lots of ways, and are working on improving them, for<=

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see any reason this wouldn&#39;t work exactly as it a=
lready<br>
&gt; &gt; does if we<br>
&gt; implement it as a preprocessor.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The last bit that I would like to add is the ability for the Include<b=
r>
&gt; to be a URI so it could be a web address or Github location. Should<br=
>
&gt; be easy enough to implement using a shell based case statement.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks, this is a great idea!<br>
