Subject: Re: [Singularity] Can a singularity container execute programs

Hey Jonathan,

The environment between the container and your host should be seamless, so
if you have an "external" job manager, given that the command is on the
path when you are inside the container (e.g., if you were to add something
like --containall you would limit sharing from the host). It sounds like in
your case you want to check the following things:

0. That R and rslurm is found within the container, period
1. That the R in your container is using the R library on the host with the
correct RSlurm
2. That no "other" installation of Rslurm in the container (that isn't
properly configured with your cluster) is being used instead
3. if it's the case that a container version of Rslurm is being used, that
it is configured correctly.

So to start, I would simply do an interactive shell into the container, and
start testing.

*singularity shell container.simg*

which R
R

>> do some tests here for rslurm

Once you get started if you want to send progress back to the list there
are probably enough R and slurm folk on here to help out. After you are
confident about the things being used / called, try executing some working
command to the container to test it out, eg:

*singularity exec container.simg Rscript myscript.R*

TLDR: you shouldn't need to send commands "up" one environment level
because you are on the correct level - the environments are shared.

Best,

Vanessa
