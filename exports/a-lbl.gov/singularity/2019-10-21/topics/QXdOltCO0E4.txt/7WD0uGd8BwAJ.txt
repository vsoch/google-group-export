I'm trying to help a user run RStudio server in a container on an HPC 
system where neither of us have root access. This is using Singularity 
2.4-dist under Scientific Linux 7.

I create the Singularity container from a Docker image:
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/rstudio

When I try to run the container on the HPC system, it has problems writing 
to /var, which is of course not surprising. My understanding is that 
RStudio server
wants to run as root.

[paciorek@ln002 paciorek]$ singularity run --writable rstudio2.img 
s6-mkdir: warning: unable to mkdir /var/run/s6: Permission denied

This feels like something that must come up frequently (and I have had 
similar things come up when trying to run PostgreSQL in a Singularity 
container), so
I think I must be missing something fairly basic about standard Singularity 
usage in such situations.

Chris
