Apologies for any misleading documentation. Can you point me at the files
that suggested it is currently supported in Singularity so it can be fixed?

We did have support (contributed by Dave), but there was another change
that broke the Docker integration and Dave was unable to fix his
contribution (due to non-technical reasons). I looked at the code, fixed
the errors as I could, but I am not a Docker expert, and I could not get it
to work as documented. Considering I was under pressure to release 2.1, I
removed the command line help documentation for the feature but left the
code with the hope that it will get fixed. It should in theory still be in
the 2.1* releases.

At this point, there has been parallel development by other team members
and work with docker2singularity, and now there is a strong push to get
that integrated into Singularity proper. One of the primary goals will of
course be to support older versions of Docker.

The "import" Singularity command I wrote because it is easy to support a
standard tar stream. But as you noticed, it does lack certain functionality
that we are hoping to integrate moving forward with two possibilities:

1. Support bootstrap'ing from a Docker container (either local or possibly
remote)
2. Smarter import as we are currently doing

This would be greatly appreciated! As would a generalized feature list. As
I said, I am not a Docker expert, but there are a lot of Docker experts in
the group so it might be valuable to them to make sure that the features
you want to see are supported.

My pleasure, and I'm glad Singularity is useful to you!


Greg.
