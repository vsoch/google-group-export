Hi,

Basically, we have different warewulf vnfs OS images and we want to create 
a containers based on these images. The distro isn't available on something 
like Dockerhub, so pulling from Dockerhub or Singularity hub isn't 
possible. A warewulf vnfs is basically something you can chroot too, so I 
would think it should be possible to package that up into a container, 
either a singularity container or a docker container.

I have previously treated this chrootable vnfs as a singularity "sandbox" 
and ran the conversion tools (I can successfully do a singularity shell 
/path/to/vnfs), but it wasn't clear to me if there were any drawbacks to 
this, as the fake "sandbox" doesn't have any of the singularity metadata in 
it. Will this be a problem?

Thanks,
Jai
