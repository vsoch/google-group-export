Okay. Will this create the appropriate metadata or does that metadata need
to be I'm the tar.gz?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Basically, we have different warewulf vnfs OS images and =
we want to create a containers based on these images. The distro isn&#39;t =
available on something like Dockerhub, so pulling from Dockerhub or Singula=
rity hub isn&#39;t possible. A warewulf vnfs is basically something you can=
 chroot too, so I would think it should be possible to package that up into=
 a container, either a singularity container or a docker container.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have previously treated this chrootable vnfs as a singu=
larity &quot;sandbox&quot; and ran the conversion tools (I can successfully=
 do a singularity shell /path/to/vnfs), but it wasn&#39;t clear to me if th=
ere were any drawbacks to this, as the fake &quot;sandbox&quot; doesn&#39;t=
 have any of the singularity metadata in it. Will this be a problem?<br>
