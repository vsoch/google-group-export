Thanks! You may as well direct him to the thread on the HTCondor-users mailing list:
https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2017-October/msg00114.shtml
It includes all the context and suggestions.

With Singularity, you don't need that, and you can just use the Singularity shell idea I mentioned earlier, or the (very simple and clean) solution that Jeff mentioned. But... If you want to instead join an existing set of namespaces, Singularity supports that with instances, however I'm not sure a running instance is required.

For Singularity, this also requires https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/934 <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/934> <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/934 <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/934>> to go in.

Understood, certainly, the patch is really important, but also rather large - so I totally understand review will take a bit ;-).

Thanks, I'm looking forward to that - in our setup with containers on CVMFS, we don't need overlayfs, so user namespaces would certainly be preferred (if HTCondor learns to handle them well).

If possible, I would like users to access a cluster and be instantly transported into the Singularity container. Steven Brandt posted some code recently, and I have some hacky code that allows remote command execution, but I am stuck on scp file transfer:

Furthermore, is this even sane, are other people considering this? If so, could Singularity handle all the logic about what to do itself, or does it need some boilerplate wrapper?
