Hi Cedric,

Yes, always be truthful! I second that!

Regarding your findings, yes, you are 100% correct in that the IB support
must be present within the container for the MPI to be able to communicate
with the underlying hardware. There is no way to virtualize that as of yet,
and yes, this does have an impact on portability due to the reliance of
kernel<->userspace compatibility within the OFED stack. We would like to
mitigate this but it will take collaboration with the OFED community which
still needs to happen (and introductions would be greatly appreciated from
anybody on the list).

Singularity by default will blur the lines between container and host as
much as possible, and that includes sharing devices between the
environments. So from a container perspective, Singularity really lends
itself to this easily. But, from a user-space and environment perspective,
you will still need the necessary libraries to communicate with the
underlying hardware; this is true in a container or when running on the
host proper.

Now to your questions.

1. The configure options (as far as I know) will be auto-discovered as long
as you have the necessary IB development environment installed wherever you
are building OMPI/MVAPICH.

2. Yes, you should embed all of the libraries and headers necessary to work
on the hardware configurations you wish to be compatible with. Luckily, we
have figured this out with GPUs, but not OFED, Qlogic, or OmniPath.

Hope that helps!

Greg
