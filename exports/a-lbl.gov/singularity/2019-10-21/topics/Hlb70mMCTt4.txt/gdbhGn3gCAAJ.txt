Hi Brandon,
I haven't experimented, but I believe on more recent kernels (possible
CentOS 7.4 or greater or Ubuntu 16.04 or greater) you don't need the setuid
bit on the singularity binary so it should just work. At the moment I don't
think bind mount will work because the bind mount will cause the nosuid
option to be applied so you will still not have permission.

Having said that I'd like the ask the singularity devs, would it be
possible or desirable to implement a site specific (i.e. must be configured
in /etc) option to bind certain directories or binaries while preserving
the suid bit

Personally I would use this option to allow Xorg to be installed outside
the container, but use a window manager installed inside the container
(this has implications for use of things like virtualgl allowing GPUs to
accelerate VNC sessions). Obviously older kernels could use this to bind
mount singularity outside the container with the suid bit inside the
container. This in turn would enable my site to have a window manager
inside a container and individual pieces of software in different
containers.

Cheers,

Chris.
