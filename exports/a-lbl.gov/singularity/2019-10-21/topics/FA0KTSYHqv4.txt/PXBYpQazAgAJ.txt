Hi Everyone!

Apologies for the late response - I am still traveling, but wanted to take
a few minutes to join the discussion.

And @Remy submit a PR to get the size programatically as well, stop the
container, and a check
<https://github.com/vsoch/singularity-tools/blob/master/docker/docker2singularity.sh>
to ensure the user has sudo (given the need for docker).

+1. It looks like this is a pretty reasonable thing to do!

Will do - likely when I get back from my trip next week. I'll also think a
bit about good places to put images. +1 what Greg mentioned about ease of
grabbing an image.
