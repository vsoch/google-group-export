I think @Samy is saying he doesn't want to use --bind at all, because the
run command is already long and ugly. Having a --bind (or similar other for
the user to define) would of course be optimal. Other than:

 - user variable for runtime
 - custom mount to consistent location in container
 - writing to TMP or HOME (or environment variable that points to likely
location to be bound automatically by Singularity)
 - using a workflow tool / language
 - environment or other config settings

I'm not sure I have any more ideas. Thoughts?
