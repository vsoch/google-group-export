Hi, Krishna,

Jie is traveling internationally. Here is the new update from us.

We found that with mpirun_rsh, the parent process did not get back from 
singularity_fork() in `singularity_sessiondir_init'.

It seems that it keeps on waiting on signal from watchdog (poll(fds, 
watchdog_rpipe == -1 ? 2 : 3, -1)).


We are pretty sure this difference, compared to the case without 
mpirun_rsh. 


Any thoughts here?


Thanks,

Xiaoyi
