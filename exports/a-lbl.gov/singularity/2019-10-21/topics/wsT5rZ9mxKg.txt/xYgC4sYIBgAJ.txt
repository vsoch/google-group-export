Hi Vanessa,

  I am primarily talking about Singularity Registry.  I am OK with just 
pushing versioned containers and not "latest".  I was just trying to 
understand whether "latest" could just be an extra tag applied to an upload 
with a <version> tag so that we can declare a newer release as latest, or 
if it would have to be its own separate upload.  In a more general sense, 
can we have multiple tags for different things with a single image upload 
or is it one tag per upload?

-Mike
