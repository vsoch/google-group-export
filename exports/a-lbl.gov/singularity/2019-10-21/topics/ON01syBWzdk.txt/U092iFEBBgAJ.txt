Subject: Re: [Singularity] Native SLURM integration
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

In this use case, I don't think of Singularity as something the user
invokes as part of a script in a job - but that the OS environment
becomes a job property, and it is the batch system's responsibility to
set things up.  Singularity is just giving an assist to the batch
system.

For the inspiration, see NERSC's Shifter integration:

http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/using-shifter-and-docker/running-jobs-with-shifter/

This would take the idea one step further and remove all references to
the underlying implementation (ideally, someone could write an
equivalent SLURM plugin for Docker or RunC or .... and keep the same
interface).

To me, this is a more useful abstraction - oh, and you could then
deploy and use Singularity on the worker node without setuid, a BIG
plus.

As far as RM-specific code: indeed, where possible, it's useful to
push the integration to the RM itself.  That's how it works with
HTCondor.  However, the SLURM plugin system is a bit different.

I don't mind having RM-specific code, provided that it doesn't come at
the cost of different RM.  I'd hope we'd accept a pull request from
Torque or SGE in the same manner.  As a separate analogy - we have
lots of Docker-specific code, but it doesn't mean that we'd reject
that enables Great Format X (assuming it's maintainable, clean, has a
maintainer, etc, etc).
