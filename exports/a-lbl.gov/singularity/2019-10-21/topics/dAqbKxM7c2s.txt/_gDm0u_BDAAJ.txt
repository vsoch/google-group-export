Hi Xiaoyi,

Two things would help -

1) Output of "ps faux" when done with the mpirun case.  This will help
understand which processes are running and have which parentage.
2) For the case that's sticking, for any singularity processes, a stack trace.

The poll command you reference tends to be waiting on a sub-process to
exec, so it's possible we are not looking at the right thing.

Thanks,

Brian
