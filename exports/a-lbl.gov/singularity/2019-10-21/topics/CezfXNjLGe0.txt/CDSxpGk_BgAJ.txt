Hi Nathan,

I have found exactly the same version of NVIDIA driver and extracted from
it the libraries and nvidia executables and copied them in
/usr/lib64/nvidia and /usr/bin and created the corresponding symbolic
links. However, I still cannot use GPU inside singularity: nvidia-smi says
"GPU access blocked by the operating system" (does it work in your case?)
and when tensorflow session starts it also complains that "No GPU devices
available on machine". However, notice that tensorflow seems to think that
a different version of NVIDIA driver is used. Not sure where it is coming
from. The machine on which the image was built has version 361.42
