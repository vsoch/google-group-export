Hi Igor,

Specifically it needs the command:

# chmod 4755 $libexecdir/singularity/sexec

But if I am understanding the scenario you describe, even then it won't
work because you are changing the install path which would break
Singularity (among other programs) because it relies on knowing where the
other installed files exist (eg. it's config file and helper scripts).

Unless you used $DESTDIR when installing into the staging directory:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ make install DESTDIR=/stagedir

And then:

# rsync /stagedir/* /

That would heroically get the paths right but it seems dangerous to me.

Anyway, it is probably best to just do the make install as root to wherever
it was configure to exist. Also then the admins can control the features
via the config file. I recommend using RPM or DEB packaging formats to make
it consistent. There is documentation on how to create RPMS and I need to
write one up for DEB still.

Hope that helps!
