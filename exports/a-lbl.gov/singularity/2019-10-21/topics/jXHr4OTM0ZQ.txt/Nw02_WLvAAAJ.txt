This thread is indeed highly interesting to me since it reassures me of a=
=20
lot of what I experience and deal with during my attempts to establish a=20
containerized HPC container building environment.
I see a strong demand for a safe way an privileged admin group is able to=
=20
create and maintain singularity containers as non-root, ideally even=20
unprivileged users.

I recently tested shifter for that purpose, too, and found a few things=20
which can be done there which are nice, especially the image gateway=20
service which is accessible by users, and that when I import docker=20
containers some pre/post conversion trigger scripts can be executed on a=20
user level.=20
But all in all, it is not feature complete, and I prefer singularity which=
=20
seems more mature.

Hence, a container building service tightly coupled to the singularity=20
runtime would be great!
I tested remote solutions such as docker hub and singularity hub and both=
=20
have the problem that local data / SW is not directly accessible and must=
=20
therefore be transferred beforehand.
Also a singularity/docker installation on my local PC as an requirement to=
=20
maintain and create customized containers is IMO too much of an requirement=
=20
if we want to convince our user base to switch from established=20
non-container workflows to containerized ones.

leges on the running<br>
host, not much different that giving allowing users to &quot;sudo docker ..=
.&quot;<br>
<br>
