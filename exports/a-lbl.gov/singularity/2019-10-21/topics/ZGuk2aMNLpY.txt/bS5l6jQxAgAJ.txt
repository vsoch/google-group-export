Stefan,

the apps are fairly random. Just recently we had one user with an IDL 
program that crashes in Linux due to an IDL bug, but works on Windows, and 
a standalone program for mass spectrometer data processing that uses .NET.

I would definitely not call any of these a typical HPC program but they 
both are multi-threaded so they can benefit from a 20-30 core cluster node 
rather than a local lab 4-core desktop.

Now we tell these people to use our 20+ core Windows server but there's 
only one and multiple users so it's not much of an improvement from their 
local setup.

I would estimate the number of these requests at ~ 1/month, and, many of 
them are not very serious, but, it's something we need to keep in mind.

MC
