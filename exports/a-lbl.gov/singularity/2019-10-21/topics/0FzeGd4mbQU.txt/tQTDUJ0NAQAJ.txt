Hey there,

Sorry to hear that you are running into trouble.

Before attempting to answer your question it is my duty to point out that
only the latest open source version of Singularity is officially
supported.  The versions of Singularity that you are listing above have
several high and medium severity security issues and should be removed.
Check these release notes for details.

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases

In older versions of Singularity (prior to 2.4) Singularity had a bootstrap
command.  One needed to first create an empty ext3 image file of a
particular size and then bootstrap the definition file into the ext3
image.  This 2 step process was combined into the build command which does
things a little differently under the hood and yields a squashfs image
instead.

Here is some info:

http://singularity.lbl.gov/archive/docs/v2-2/docs-bootstrap

And here is where you can find older docs.

http://singularity.lbl.gov/archive/

Hope that helps!

Dave
