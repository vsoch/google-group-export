Since yesterday, I have been unable to use the Sylabs Cloud builder (
https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder) to build a container. This has previously 
worked. I was trying to use a docker container on NGC, however I switched 
to a basic def file (below) to rule out NGC authentication issues. The 
symptom is I paste the definition contents int the Build a Recipe section, 
I am told that the definition file is valid, and I click Build. The build 
then shows it's running. When I look at the log output, nothing is 
displayed. The build timer keeps track of build time and after an hour or 
so it simply fails with no message as to why. 

I have generated new API keys and have login using the remote login command 
from my on-premise machine. When I paste in my API key, it says it was 
verified.

Any clues?

%runscript
    echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."


%post
    echo "Hello from inside the container"
    sed -i 's/$/ universe/' /etc/apt/sources.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get -y install vim
    apt-get clean
