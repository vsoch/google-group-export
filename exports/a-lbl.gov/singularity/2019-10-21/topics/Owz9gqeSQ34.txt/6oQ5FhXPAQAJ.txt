Hello there, I got now with a new *issue* on my adventure with Singularity 
containers.   I have an application it doesn't like FQDN but the short name 
of the host. The host OS is running CentOS7 and we want this application to 
run on a CentOS6 launched container as due to legacy dependencies.  By 
default, the hostname command will produce the long host name (FQDN) coming 
from the host OS but on the container we want the short name, so we are 
launching the container by doing this:

*singularity shell --hostname $(hostname -s) contianer-image.sif*

By doing this, the involved application is happy now... well, not yet... 
there is collateral damage... now DISPLAY is complaining... users are not 
happy with the "Can't open display" message.  

I tried to solve this by using SINGULARITYENV_DISPLAY and "force" the 
passing of the env var (localhost:x.0) but it doesn't work... uncle Google 
didn't give me good hints so I', asking my now my Singularity Community 
friends for some ideas on how to get down this issue.

Thanks in advance!
