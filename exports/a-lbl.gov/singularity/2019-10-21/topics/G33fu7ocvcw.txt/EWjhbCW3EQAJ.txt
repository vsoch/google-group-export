Dave, this topic now came with a high importance within our organization as=
=20
from the security folks.  You have described a good report on what you guys=
=20
internally are working to validate the impact of this vulnerability over=20
Singularity containers.  Do you have an official statement we can share=20
with security folks to make them happy by saying our Singularity containers=
=20
are NOT affected by this vulnerability? I can explain on your behalf but=20
they want an official document from the source... you know what I'm talking=
=20
about.

Let me know!

Thanks,
-Hugo
