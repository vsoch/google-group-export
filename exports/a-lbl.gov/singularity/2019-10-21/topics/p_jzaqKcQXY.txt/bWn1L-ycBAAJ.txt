Subject: Re: [Singularity] Bootstrap InstallPkgs config (rhel)

Yum in my experience has not been consistent with regards to how it handles
installroot and the configuration.

But I am more curious on what the behavior should be with regards to
bootstrapping.

If we do this in our definition file:

InstallPkg epel-release
RunCmd yum update
InstallPkg .....

Should the second InstallPkg pull from EPEL? I would vote yes, but.... That
means that the bootstrap may have a different source/mirror URL then the
installed OS. Is that the desire behavior? Should we modify the default
installed yum.conf to match the MirrorURL in the definition file (I believe
that is what debootatrap does with the sources.list).

Thoughts?
