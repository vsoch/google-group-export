I'll fix this asap, probably a little before and after my talk. This also
brings up an important point - it would be good to have some hard,
validation criteria for images. Any time an image is created, or uploaded
somewhere, we would want to validate it first. Are there a few simple
commands that satisfy this goal? Having a test for images and packages
would prevent me messing up something like that :)

The reason I want to do this isn't to just replicate the Docker images (we
can already do this with docker2singularity) but rather to have a
representation of an image that is a simple, flat file, storable in a
github repo, and can be collaboratively worked on (for example, I can look
at a Dockerfile and see the installs, versions, and then collaborate via
PRs on github). We need equivalent ease of use for singularity.

>

>
> Using native docker (internal) stuffs to produce the image vs. Docker
export commands seems like a step in the right direction in that it
produces a more robust, (likely long term stable) solution, but it still
doesn't have a singularity representation that can be collaborated on. If
you are suggesting that we can go (always) from Dockerfile --> singularity
image (so singularity export becomes part of Docker) this is a great idea
because it eliminates redundancy in having two kinds of files, but then you
are putting your eggs in the Docker company basket. If there are negatives
/ drawbacks of that, then it might not be a good idea.

that more people are going to be able to work on. It's a big enough task
convincing people to learn something like python, Perl is going to keep
development of this to a very small crowd, which I don't think is ideal.

convert a Dockerfile (seen any of those laying around anywhere?) into a sin=
gularity spec file!</div></div></blockquote><div><br></div></span><div>So s=
omething I am going to be working on (and requesting yours and potentially =
other&#39;s help) is to have Singularity actually leverage Docker behind th=
e scenes so it can take a Dockerfile and create the Singularity image from =
that. At that point, we don&#39;t need to replicate the Dockerfile lingo an=
d then the Singularity bootstrap definition/recipe files will be more robus=
t and reliable for Singularity&#39;s purpose.</div></div></div></div></bloc=
kquote><div><br></div><div>The reason I want to do this isn&#39;t to just r=
eplicate the Docker images (we can already do this with docker2singularity)=
 but rather to have a representation of an image that is a simple, flat fil=
e, storable in a github repo, and can be collaboratively worked on (for exa=
mple, I can look at a Dockerfile and see the installs, versions, and then c=
ollaborate via PRs on github). We need equivalent ease of use for singulari=
ty.=C2=A0</div><blockquote class=3D"gmail_quote" style=3D"margin:0px 0px 0p=

ernal) stuffs to produce the image vs. Docker export commands seems like a =
step in the right direction in that it produces a more robust, (likely long=
 term stable) solution, but it still doesn&#39;t have a singularity represe=
ntation that can be collaborated on. If you are suggesting that we can go (=
always) from Dockerfile --&gt; singularity image (so singularity export bec=
omes part of Docker) this is a great idea because it eliminates redundancy =
in having two kinds of files, but then you are putting your eggs in the Doc=
ker company basket. If there are negatives / drawbacks of that, then it mig=
