Hello,

I will speak next week in a workshop about reproducible science and=20
portability and I wouldn't lie about MPI and Singularity containers.

I managed to run MPI applications with Singularity and OpenMPI.

So I installed version 2.1.0rc4 on host (centos 6) and container (ubuntu=20
16.04), by following the documentation I simply compiled OpenMPI in=20
container with
./configure && make && make install.
On the host: ./configure --with-sge --with-psm && make && make install

All works as expected with a hello example. To be sure it run on=20
Infiniband, I launched a PingPong between two hosts
and latency results show it used Ethernet.
The solution was to install libpsm-infinipath1 and libpsm-infinipath1-dev=
=20
package and recompile OMPI with ./configure --with-psm

All documentations just did ./configure in container without any options.

I red in this group that MVAPICH works without problem with singularity,=20
give it a try: same behaviour, need to install psm headers too and=20
recompile.

and came to these questions:

   - is there some options to pass in configure on OMPI/MVAPICH host
   - for portability should I embed all libs/headers to work with many=20
   hardware configurations (mellanox, glogic, intel)
  =20
It would be grateful if you would share you experience about that

Regards,
C=C3=A9dric Clerget
