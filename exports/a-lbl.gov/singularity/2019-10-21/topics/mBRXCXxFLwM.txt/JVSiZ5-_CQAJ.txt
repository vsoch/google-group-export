Subject: Re: [Singularity] Failed to obtain user identity information (as
 non-root user)
To: singularity@lbl.gov

Hi Rob,

  Hrmmm... The "Failed to obtain user identity information" was just
added in after we ran into this issue with another user. Do you have
sssd running?

  Can we see the output from a shell:  ls -l /proc/self/fd/

  For the previous issue see:
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/1489

  This all comes back to the same issue.... we can't look-up your user
information from the authentication server. We had _hoped_ in 2.5.1
this was fixed. :/
