Hi Thomas,

You are totally right, and I updated the docs to show the user this, but
(still) advise to act "reproducibly" and use a proper bootstrap to make
changes to a container. Take a look -->
http://singularity.lbl.gov/quickstart#commands-needing-root and let me know
if anything more needs work.

Best,

Vanessa
