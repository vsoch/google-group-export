Subject: Re: [Singularity] Include custom python PATH

In my case, the singularity is also installed as my regular user. So both
the singularity binary and python would be owned by the same user. Conda is
similar to virtualenv, if you're familiar with that, in that most packages
get installed in a non-standard (i.e. non-/usr/local) "per-project
environment" directory. It sounds like the feature you describe would be
useful for the python binary as well.

Being able to run singularity as a non-root user (and without setuid) has
limitations, but it has uses. I'm not 100% familiar with the security
model, but it looks like, at least, I could run containers in user
namespaces without root access. Being able to pick up a custom python would
help.
