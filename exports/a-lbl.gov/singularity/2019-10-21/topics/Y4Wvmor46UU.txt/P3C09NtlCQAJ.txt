`release-2.5` is a branch in the GitHub repository, and is the ongoing work=
=20
that will eventually be cut into a 2.5.x release.

You can download the commit that is currently in that branch from an URL=20
like:

  https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/archive/release-2.5.tar.gz

Once you've unpacked the `singularity-release-2.5.tar.gz` tarball, you need=
=20
to run `autogen.sh` to generate the build scripts like `configure`.

You can also check out a git repository with the same contents by the=20
following command:

  git clone -b release-2.5=20
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git singularity-release-2.5
