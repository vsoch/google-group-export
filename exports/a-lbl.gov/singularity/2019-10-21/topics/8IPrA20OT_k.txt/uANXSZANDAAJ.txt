Heya everyone,

Just wanted to give the heads up of the status of the current development
and a foreshadow of what to expect in the 2.2 release.

At present, the current development branch (which will be merged into
'master' soon) can do:

* Code restructure to better enable new features and support
* Support for multiple image types (existing image, directory,
tarball/archive, etc..)
* Completely unprivileged execution (does not work with images and requires
very new kernel)
* OverlayFS support for automatic creation of bind point
* Optional execution with no process management fork

These are things that I am planning but not started working on yet
(volunteers?):

* Much better Docker integration
* New bootstrap definition syntax (will still support previous format)

Did I miss any feature requests?

I am also considering dropping support for RHEL5 vintage of systems (only
hosts, not in containers) for several reasons, but if you will need to be
implementing back to RHEL5, I can put emphasis on this so let me know.

Thanks!
