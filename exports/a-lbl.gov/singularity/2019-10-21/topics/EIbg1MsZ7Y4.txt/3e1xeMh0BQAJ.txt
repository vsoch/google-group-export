Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity + Snakemake: Snakemake does not

And to debug I would try to do a sanity check to, at the start of a run,
print out what snakemake knows to be the inputs, knows to be the outputs,
and which of these do and don't exist. If you do that between two runs we
should minimally get an understanding of its state and go from there.
