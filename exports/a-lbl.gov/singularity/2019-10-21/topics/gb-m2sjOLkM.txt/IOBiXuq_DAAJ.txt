It is indeed an RPM problem in that that is how YUM determines the correct
release version of the system. It does something roughly equivalent to:

   rpm -qf /etc/redhat-release --qf '%{VERSION}'

What you will find is that the above command won't work inside your
container... Meaning, it will not return the version. Neither will the
command `rpm -qa` (which should output a list of all packages installed)
show all of the packages you have installed. This is because the RPM
Berkeley database which was written during the first stage of bootstrap'ing
is unreadable by the container's version of RPM.

This will work, yes... But, it will also reinstall all previously installed
RPMS which are dependencies of vim-minimal because it doesn't think there
are any packages currently installed.

Since we technically have the OS Release, we could do this, but I'm
hesitant because it will end up with some packages being installed twice
and some installed packages not consistent with the RPM database. For
instance, glibc was installed during the first core operating system
installation stage, and then will be done again in the %post as YUM/RPM
doesn't know it is already installed.

No errors, but the RPM database is not consistent with the installed
packages.

That is exactly what I'm referring to. The file `/usr/bin/db_load` is
installed as you can see, but it is not known to the RPM database because
the RPM DB is now inconsistent with the state of the installed system.
While that maybe reasonable for some disposable containers, it is generally
a bad situation and not something we should proliferate.

Great to hear that the 2.x branch (which will lead to a 2.2.1 release) is
working well. Thank you for testing that! If anyone else wants to test,
please do so and let us know how it is working so we can push out a minor
dot release in the 2.2 release stream.

Thanks again!

Greg
