Heya everyone,

I just wanted to give the heads up for anyone following the master branch
via Github. I just pushed a bunch of commits that will diverge from the 1.x
level of functionality. Thus if you are interested in following with the
latest stable released code, then make sure you pull from the 1.x branch
rather then master.

And in case you are wondering what is in master (and thus in
experimentation for Singularity v2):

[gmk@centos7-x64 src]$ SINGULARITY_IMAGE=/tmp/Centos-7.img ./sexecimg shell
-c "/bin/cat /etc/redhat-release"
CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)
[gmk@centos7-x64 src]$ SINGULARITY_IMAGE=/tmp/Centos-5.img ./sexecimg shell
-c "/bin/cat /etc/redhat-release"
CentOS release 5.11 (Final)

Notice the SINGULARITY_IMAGE environment variable is pointed at an image
file. When you launch the container you are literally "inside" that image
file. The file will grow and shrink in real time depending on what you are
doing inside the container. Within this image, you could have an entire
operating system image, or you can have a very lightweight simple
container. Additionally there is no need to install or cache a container
before running it, and there is no startup cost penalty for very large
containers.

At present, the entire implementation is in C, but when/if this model gets
released it will have shell script launchers that control the binary code
on the back end (similar to the GA code).

There are some caveats to this model, but there are also some MAJOR
benefits that I won't list here... yet. But the model is still being
evaluated so if anybody is interested in knowing more details, I'm happy to
answer questions and hear people's perspectives.

Have a great weekend!
