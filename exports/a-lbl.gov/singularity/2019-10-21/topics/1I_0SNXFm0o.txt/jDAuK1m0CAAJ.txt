Subject: Re: [Singularity] problem with singularity app not reading from stdin
From: "Gregory M. Kurtzer" <gmku...@lbl.gov>
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=047d7b5d461cbc9e7c0526f8e19a

Nevermind, it is not necessary to paste the sspec file. I was able to
replicate the problem and I found the bug. These are the early growing
pains of not having any released versions yet... Sorry about that! LOL

Please do a git pull, and test the latest commit(s).

Thanks,
Greg
