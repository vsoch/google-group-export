Hey Petar,

I am forwarding your question to the list to get the best, and quickest
answers.

points

To start, could you run the command with --debug and share the output? The
first thing you should see is this line:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/e90ee1ba4e565a7cf787878=
0892d3ce3843c69db/src/lib/mount/hostfs/hostfs.c#L52

I'd guess either the command isn't being parsed correctly, there is a
library conflict with some older version, exec has some dependency on
accessing local files, or even with the configuration, the mounts are still
sniffed (but not altered).

If you can share the debug output, it will give more insight to the issue,
and then we can go from there! :)

Best,

Vanessa
