Hello,

It seems that for some images from dockerhub, singularity pull or import 
fails with an error message

ERROR Improperly formed manifest, layers or fsLayers must be present

Example:

 $ sudo singularity pull --size 1024 docker://ubuntu:latest
Initializing Singularity image subsystem
Opening image file: ubuntu-latest.img
Creating 1024MiB image
Binding image to loop
Creating file system within image
Image is done: ubuntu-latest.img
Docker image path: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest
ERROR Improperly formed manifest, layers or fsLayers must be present

Same with import to existing .img file.
The problem also occurs with other images, e.g. for ubuntu:16.04, 
ubuntu:16.04.1, ubuntu:16.04.3, ubuntu:14.04, debian:stable

But, for ubuntu:14.04.1 and centos:latest, the images download and run 
fine. I have no problem pulling and running any of those images with docker.

The problem began less than 24 hours ago (now is 13 Sep. 2017, 13:00 UTC). 
I cross checked by rolling back my virtual test host system to a snapshot 
and by installing singularity on a clean physical host. My hosts are 
running Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.

The output from "singularity -vvvv import" is

 $ singularity create -s 1024 ubuntu.img
Initializing Singularity image subsystem
Opening image file: ubuntu.img
Creating 1024MiB image

Creating file system within image

 $ sudo singularity -vvvv import ubuntu.img docker://ubuntu:latest

I see no substantial deviation for the cases that work

even the 401 error is present.

I can only suppose that something in the way dockerhub are delivering their 
images has changed that is partially incompatible with Singularity. I'd 
appreciate any help - I am just in the process of convincing our users that 
Singularity is the way to go with complex software installations - too bad 
if it seems not to work.

Thanks! Mike
