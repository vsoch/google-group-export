Subject: Re: [Singularity] How to tell singularity to use a specific config file?

One way is to use the SINGULARITY_BINDPATH environmental variable.  User's
can set that in their .bashrc if they always want it to be the same, and if
you want to change it for a particular container you can write a wrapper
script that set's everything up at runtime.

Here's an example wrapper script:

#!/bin/bash
SINGULARITY_BINDPATH=3D"/gpfs,/gs2,/gs3,/gs4,/gs5,/spin1,/data,/scratch,/fd=
b,/lscratch"
export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH
dir=3D$(dirname  "$0")
cmd=3D$(basename "$0")
args=3D"$@"
singularity exec $dir/digits.img $cmd $args

If you put this in the same directory with an image called digits.img, then
you can create symliks to the wrapper script that become commands to be
executed from within your container.  For instance,

digits-devserver -> digits.sh
python -> digits.sh

Now if the directory with all of this stuff is on your path and you type
python, you will be dumped into an interactive python prompt within the
digits container with all of the bind mounts listed (assuming the image
contains this stuff).
