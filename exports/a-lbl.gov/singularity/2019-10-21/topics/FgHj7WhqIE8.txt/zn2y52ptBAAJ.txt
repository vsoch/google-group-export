Let me offer a counterpoint for the thread.

I'd say the only reason security patches should be held until the start of 
the week is if the vulnerability is privately known.

Our HPC cluster is used 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. We are a global 
company and "the weekend" really means nothing. The second the 
vulnerability is posted to a public forum like this google group or github 
issue tracking then that's when the 0-day clock starts, it does not start 
when the patch is released. Holding back a patch just increases the 
zero-day window into a period [the weekend] where there might be fewer eyes 
on the cluster and a greater potential for someone to experiment with 
exploiting the vulnerability.

If it's a publicaly known security issue and it's serious then I'd 
recommend releasing the patch as soon as possible and not waiting.

At the end of the day, if I know about the vulnerability, I'd rather have 
the ability to patch and hold back myself over the weekend, if I choose, 
versus not having a choice at all. Sylabs holding back a patch for a 
publicly known vulnerability would just condemn us all and remove admin 
choice.

In the same thread, you might offer someone channels where people can 
submit security vulnerabilities such as the slack channel or direct email 
before posting them directly in one of the Google searchable public 
locations. If it can be kept private until a patch is available, then, by 
all means, release at the beginning of the week and post a public github 
issue at the same time pointing to the patch.

Many of us also understand that these security patches might be rushed and 
have issues. 2.4.6, for example, would have broken every container we have 
for the majority of our users. 2.5.0 appears to have fixed the issue while 
still patching the security vulnerability. There were three weeks in 
between these releases, but if the releases had been back to back, then I 
wouldn't have wanted to wait a whole other week to get the vulnerability 
fix simply to occur at the beginning of the week.

Greg, from what you've posted, I think you're spot on for the security 
related patches. ASAP is best when possible.

Thanks,
-Jeff
