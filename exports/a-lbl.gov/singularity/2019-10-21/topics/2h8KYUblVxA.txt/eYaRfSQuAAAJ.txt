A few questions inline... <br>

</span>&gt; Greetings Singularity users,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
<span>&gt; The Singularity team has been working to support older legacy ke=
rnels that do not instantiate the prctlfunction PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS.=C2=A0 =
Starting in version 2.5, Sylabs is giving up on that fight and outdated ker=
nels will no longer be supported. =C2=A0<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We, at Sylabs, recently discovered an exploit vector to all container =
runtimes which allows a malicious user to gain additional privileges within=
 a container on hosts that do not support the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVSfeature.<b=
r>
<br>
Does this statement also hold for container runtimes using user namespaces =
only? <br>
Is there a CVE? <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
</span>&gt; The PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVSfeature was added to prctl()in the Linux=
 3.5 kernel. Various distributions have since backported this feature to cu=
rrently maintained kernels (for example, Red Hat added this feature to RHEL=
 6.7 with the 2.6.32-504.16.2kernel). The most effective way to determine i=
f your system is affected by this issue is to test the support directly.=C2=
=A0 As a convenience Sylabs provides a script to allow you to do that autom=
atically via the following command:<br>
<span>&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; curl -s <a href=3D"https://www.sylabs.io/privtest/no_new_privs.sh" rel=
=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://www.sylabs.io/privtest<wbr>/no_new_=
privs.sh</a> | bash<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
</span><span>&gt; If you find that your system does not properly support th=
is feature, you will need to either upgrade the operating system, upgrade t=
he kernel, or disable Singularity (set allow setuid =3D noin singularity.co=
nffile) and/or any other container runtime you may have installed pending a=
 kernel update.<br>
<br>
How does setting &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; &quot;disable Singularity&=
quot;? <br>
Again: If this is only affecting container runtimes needing setuid root, wh=
y should I disable others (e.g. charliecloud, runc&#39;s rootless container=
s,...)? <br>
How is PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS of any effect if there are no special privileges=
 involved? <br>
<br>
AFAIK, &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; for Singularity only disables the se=
tuid root based functionality, which many users actually do not need - last=
 time I checked it was only needed for OverlayFS and image file mounting,<b=
r>
which is to be considered unsafe anyways at least for a few years to follow=
 unless the container image source is fully trusted. &quot;limit container =
paths&quot;, or just not using image files since they are not so efficientl=
y distributed anyways,<br>
are very helpful here. <br>
See for example <a href=3D"http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1804.0=
/02163.html" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermai=
l/l<wbr>inux/kernel/1804.0/02163.html</a> which clearly states the opinion =
of the expert in the field concerning the security implications of mounting=
 image files. <br>
<br>
Still, many thanks for the heads-up, but some more detailed information alo=
ng the lines of:<br>
- who exactly is affected (it&#39;s unclear if this only affects setuid roo=
t users, and if so, it surely affects only a small subset of available othe=
r container runtimes!) <br>
- how to mitigate until one can upgrade (again, you state &quot;disable Sin=
gularity&quot; and &quot;allow setuid =3D no&quot; which are two completely=
 different things to my knowledge) <br>
- CVE / background info links, if available, would have been nice. <br>
- which versions of singularity are affected in which configurations? <br>
<br>
Or, in short, just see the mail from Dave (Dykstra) at 2018-04-07 18:21 on =
this very list asking for this (usually customary) information. <br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
