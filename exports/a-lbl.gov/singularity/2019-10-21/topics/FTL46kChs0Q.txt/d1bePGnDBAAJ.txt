That was not the case when I tested it.  The home directory mapped to
the host's /home.  Presumably that would be true on all systems where
the container is run.

Correct.  Hence my disclaimer.  But, if one is trying to create a
container to use in an HPC environment for oneself, then this might
have some utility.

-- bennet

  But you won=E2=80=99t be able to give it to someone else to run or even r=
un
it yourself on another system where you may have a different UID/GID.
Again, this may or may not be a problem. One of the use cases we are
looking at for containers is the ability for an application owner to
build a containerized version of an app and hand it off to other users
to run.  But maybe in that scenario you set umask 022 and install your
app into /usr/local so anyone can run it.  There are lots of different
use cases for containers so YMMV.
