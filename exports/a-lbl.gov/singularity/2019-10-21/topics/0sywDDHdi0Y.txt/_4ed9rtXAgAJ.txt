Ralph, this also brings up the issue of where you would want to run your
containers later.
For example, do you guys launch mpirun from the underlying host or are you
using a containerized version of that as well?

If the mpirun command doesn't match the mpi library your application is
linked to, one might get problems.
I guess this is more of a general issue of communication between
native and containerized components.

ers and check performance results. <br><br>How can I communicate with anoth=
er container? In docker this is clear because every container gets an assig=
ned IP and you can ping there, but what is the situation in the case of sin=
gularity? Is it possible to assign an IP to each container? Can I connect v=
ia ssh to them?<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br></div><div><br></div>
