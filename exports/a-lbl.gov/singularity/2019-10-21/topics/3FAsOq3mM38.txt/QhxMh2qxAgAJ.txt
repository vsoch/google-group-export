I have run HPL on a cluster (3-8 nodes) using singularity.  I used slurm to 
start several processes/containers on several nodes in my cluster for 
testing singularity.  I configured some short runs, and one run that took 
3.5 hours.  My task was to compare bare metal runs with singularity runs.  
I compared cputime and elapsed time from slurm sacct.  When starting the 
singularity runs there is a slight delay (up to 30 seconds, I'm assuming 
for the containers to load) - if that time is removed then the singularity 
and bare metal runs are nearly identical.  With the start up time, the 3.5 
hour singularity run took ~0.5% more time than bare metal.
