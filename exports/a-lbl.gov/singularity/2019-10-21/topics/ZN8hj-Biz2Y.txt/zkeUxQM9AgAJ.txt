Hey Paolo,

Check out the -c option.  (Can be used with things like shell and exec)

    -c/--contain        This option disables the automatic sharing of
writable
                        filesystems on your host (e.g. $HOME and /tmp).

I have been testing singularity to use it in our cluster. I was surprised t=
o see that the software that is installed in the computer where singularity=
 runs, it is also available from inside the container. For instance, I have=
 an R script that calls a java jar and I&#39;m calling it from singularity.=
 I do not have java installed in my container but it is still working becau=
se it uses the java that is installed in my computer.<br>
<br>
Is this behavior normal in containers? How to make sure that is using, for =
instance, the java that is installed in the container and not the one in my=
 computer? Is it just a matter of playing with the PATH? By the way, the ja=
va issue is just an example.<br>
