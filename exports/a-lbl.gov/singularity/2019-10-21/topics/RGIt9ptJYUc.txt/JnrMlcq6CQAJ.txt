Hi Luca,

Ah I see where you are coming from. The reason for Docker Hub is because we
can connect/use it without requiring the user to have Docker installed -
imagine how funny it would be to require Docker to use Singularity? If you
don't want to use the Docker Registry, your other option is to deploy your
own and use your local images -->
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/429#issuecomment-2690=
85751
It basically is a local registry running on port 5000.

Other than using Docker / Docker Hub, how would you suggest going about
adding some set of local Docker layers to an image?

Best,

Vanessa

<br>&gt;&gt; Hey Luca,
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Ah yes, I know docker2singularity well because I wrote most of=
 the runtime
<br>&gt;&gt; script, that somehow was scraped of any credit via improper us=
e of version
<br>&gt;&gt; control, lol. When you export the docker environment using tha=
t script,it
<br>&gt;&gt; writes directly to a file /environment, which mirrors how the =
very first
<br>&gt;&gt; singularity images were set up. Later images (made with singul=
arity proper)
<br>&gt;&gt; store the docker environment variables in the image&#39;s meta=
data &quot;env&quot; folder,
<br>&gt;&gt; available via shell or exec with a simple source:
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for script in /.singularity.d/env/*.sh; do
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 if [ -f &quot;$script&quot; ]; thenHere is w=
here
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 . &quot;$script&quot;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 fi
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; done
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; so you don&#39;t have the environment variables because they a=
ren&#39;t being
<br>&gt;&gt; sourced. The option with -e would clean the environment from y=
our host, not
<br>&gt;&gt; what is in the container. Here is where some of this happens, =
if it helps.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; I think if you want this to work as expected, you should put y=
our docker
<br>&gt;&gt; image on docker hub, and then bootstrap appropriately:
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; singularity create image.img
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; sudo singularity bootstrap image.img Singularity
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; This will handle the Docker environment to coincide with the c=
urrent
<br>&gt;&gt; implementation that sources it. Give that a go and see if it h=
elps.
<br>&gt;&gt;

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Luca,
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you convert from Docker, Singularity =
will automatically grab the
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ENV variables that you&#39;ve defined, so =
you shouldn&#39;t need to specify it
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice. Which of the two are you wanting to=
 not use? You can easily remove
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the extra specification from %environment.=
 If you want to disable
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; singularity adding, we don&#39;t have any =
kind of flag for that (but it could be
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily added).
