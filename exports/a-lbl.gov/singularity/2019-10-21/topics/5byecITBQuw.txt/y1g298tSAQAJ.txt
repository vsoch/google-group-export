Hi Greg,
I'm using singularity container that bootstrap a docker image requiring at 
least 4 gigabytes as RAM, otherwise incorrect results will be produced.
Is there is a way to make this singularity container runs using at least 4 
gigabytes RAM on a linux machine? or just running it over a +4 gigabytes 
RAM machine is all what I can do?

Thanks,
Aly
