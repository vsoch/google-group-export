Subject: Re: [Singularity] metalink for container URLs?

HI Thomas,

When you say "metalink" do you mean like a manifest? We can offer a version
of that via singularity hub, eg:

https://singularity-hub.org/api/containers/82

we don't have the same use case as docker that has hashes of layers
(singularity containers don't have layers) however with version 2.3 each
container will be produced with metadata, including labels, and
environment. This will be in the /.singularity.d/ folder at the base of the
image - and hopefully we will have a programmatic way to access. There is
also plans for a hash in some official kind of header, but this is unlikely
to be for 2.3. For the labels,give the development branch a try to see what
I mean. Any Docker labels, or content added to the runscript in a %labels
section should show up.

To address the "do I have it already locally?" issue we are currently using
a cache - it can be set manually with the variable SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR but
by default is your home folder + .singularity/docker (or shub depending on
what is being cached). Before any kind of import/bootstrap/download the
involves an image or layers, we look here.

Are you thinking of some kind of manifest / summary of the user's cache?
(eg, having the singularity software being able to sniff it and tell the
user what is inside?) I like that idea very much.

Best,

Vanessa
