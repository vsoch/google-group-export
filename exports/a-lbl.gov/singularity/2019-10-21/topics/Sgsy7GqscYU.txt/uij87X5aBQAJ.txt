Hi Michael,

Thanks for the detailed reply, especially item 2. In fact I did assume the
plan is "to completely re-implement the runtime in a new language",
I'd love to see someone implement the OCI in rustlang and golang as closely
as possible and compare the outcomes.

If you are aware of any efforts to implement the OCI in rustlang, please
share.

To answer your question, I mean primarily bug-fix and security-patch
releases, if any! :)

Thanks again.

Cheers,
--david
