Matt, I would be interested in the answer to this one also.
For anyone not familiar with Star-CCM it is wrapped up in a very long and
tortuous launcher script. I have had cause to look at this very closely in
the past.  You can choose different MPIs though, as I recall Platform and
OpenMPI at least. I don't think though you can specify anything of your own
making...  As an aside the wrapper also makes the GUI difficult to launch
under vglrun.

 The problem I have is with parallel jobs.=C2=A0 starccm+ wants to start it=

shell to use and which compute nodes I have requested via a machine list fi=

need to launch the containers on the compute nodes before executing the sta=

 the container is already running but I&#39;m not sure on how to accomplish=
 this.=C2=A0 Any thoughts?<span><font color=3D"#888888"><br><i></i></font><=
