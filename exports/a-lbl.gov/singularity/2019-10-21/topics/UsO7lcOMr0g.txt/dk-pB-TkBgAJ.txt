I'll be there! I can meet almost anytime from Tuesday through Thursday
(flying in on Monday). I tend to stay on EDT so I'm up early, early, early
(about 4:00 MDT).

Greg - I would suggest picking a time, announcing it, and then let people
chime in if they can't make but want to. Also, we should against some of
the BoF times since there are quite a few during the day (ask Ralph).
