Subject: Re: [Singularity] Singularity and "development mode" python package
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hello,

I believe that which program is run is influenced by the PATH variable.

On the host:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/us=
r/local/games:/snap/bin

In the container:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

On the host, ~/.local/bin/ is not in the PATH. So when running my
software from the command line on the host, it actually call
/usr/local/bin/itzi, but then, through Python's entry points system,
run the files on my development folder in my home directory.
This for the Python thing. I still don't understand how to circumvent
this behaviour and make sure that when running the container, it does
not run the file from $HOME.

Regards,
Laurent
