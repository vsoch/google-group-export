Subject: Re: [Singularity] Submit additional jobs from within a container
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

I was able to with slurm ... I did an install of the slurm package
into the container and pointed the configuration at the scheduler.

If you have, for example, Torque installed somewhere like:
/software/torque/[version]  ... you could bind mount that to the
container. I think the only variable that needs set is PBS_SERVER or
PBS_MASTER ...

Once that's set, you should be able to talk to it ... though if you're
bind mounting the install location, and the spool directory if needed,
then you shouldn't need to set the variable as it'll be read from the
config in the spool.
