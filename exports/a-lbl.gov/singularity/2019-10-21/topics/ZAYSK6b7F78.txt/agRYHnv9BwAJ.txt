Hi Sean,

Singularity on your HPC environment has been installed without SUID binary=
=20
or was disabled by the administrator in configuration.
NON-SUID workflow can only mount directory container image, file image=20
requires privileges to associate file with /dev/loopX devices, that's
why you got "Could not create /dev/loop0: Permission denied" error.
You can convert container file image into directory and run it like this :

$ singularity build --sandbox MFiX_v1-container MFiX_v1.simg
$ singularity shell MFiX_v1-container
