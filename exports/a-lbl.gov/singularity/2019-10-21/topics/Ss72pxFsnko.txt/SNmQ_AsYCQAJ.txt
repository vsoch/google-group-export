Hi,

The singularity documentation says "You don=E2=80=99t need sudo to create, =
import,=20
or shell into containers". In fact, one of the key appealing features of=20
Singularity 2.3 release is "Ability to run additional commands without root=
=20
privileges (e.g. create, import, copy, export, etc..)." as per release=20
notes (http://singularity.lbl.gov/release-2-3)
