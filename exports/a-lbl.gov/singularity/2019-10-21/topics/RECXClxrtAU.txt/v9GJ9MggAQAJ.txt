Subject: Re: [Singularity] Research data and containers
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

I start to use singularity / containers and obviously I ran into the
same question ...

a half solution that I found by exploring existing solution (thanks to
nf-core and SciLifeLab to share their workflow / containers) is ( as
far I understand ):

the container encapsulate only the sorftware.
the data are store in external repositories.

the user receive the container.

case 1:
the user download the data by himself and point his files to the container
the container use local files as resources
pros:
 * the container is slim
 * user can store the data on machine A (data server) and run the
software on machine B (analyse server)
cons:
* user is involved in downloading the right data

case 2:
the user do not have the data
the container download the data from the external repository
the container use the data it just download
pro:
* the container manage everything
cons:
* the step of downloading the data require bandwith + disk space =
time and resources

a general worry for both scenarii is:
who manage the data repository ? can we ensure the version of the data
package will be maintain ?

Waiting for your feedback ;)
Maxime
