I have found at least one combination that works, it requires a two-step 
approach:

1) Ensure that my NIX/CVMFS environment is disabled at compile time. This 
still has a couple libraries being pulled from CVMFS at runtime (due to 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting), but most are from local OS.

2) Switch from nlscd to sssd.  Honestly, not sure why this system was 
defaulted to use nlscd.

If either condition is not met, ID resolution continues to fail.

Regards,

Rob
