Ok Greg, you substitute fine "fist" by "first" in my first post! :) ^^

Indeed, I think it is also a little bit too soon, but yes, why not. However
I do not have enough time right now to do that. If you have a functional
github repository to share apps, give me the URL and I will fork it later.

Best,

Remy
