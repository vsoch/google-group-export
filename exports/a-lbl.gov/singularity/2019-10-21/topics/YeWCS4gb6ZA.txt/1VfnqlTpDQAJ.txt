Singularity seems to support lots of different MPIs, but I've been testing
and working with predominately OpenMPI myself. At SC, people have confirmed
that they are running it with MPICH, MVAPICH and Intel MPI without issue. I
can't tell you what specific versions were tested, but I've gotten numerous
reports from people with all good news.

Additionally, everyone who tried it was using the documented hybrid MPI
module; this is where part of the MPI exists outside of the container,
native on the host (so the scheduler can properly interface with it) and
that process chain invokes a `singularity exec` command which in turn runs
the containerized MPI application.

Please let us know how it goes for you!
