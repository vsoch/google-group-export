Hmm, where would this go?  I have not found an iteration of this yet that 
works.

I need a singularity call (a containerized R system() call, specifically) 
to be able to call its own implementation of squeue which can either be an 
alias or a function.  

I've tried putting:

alias squeue='ssh ${USER}@${HOSTNAME} squeue'

In both %environment and %post but either way, when I shell into the 
container and run squeue, I get a:
 bash: squeue: command not found

--j
