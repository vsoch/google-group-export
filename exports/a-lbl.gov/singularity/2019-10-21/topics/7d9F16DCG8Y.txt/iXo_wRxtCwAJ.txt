Hi Chris, Greg,

I'm also not an expert, but just to add a small comment,
It seems that at least one of the problems for singularity on FreeBSD or=20
MaxOS
(bsd kernels) is the use of clone() (with CLONE_NEWNS flag) which is linux
specific (See 2.4.1.4=20
<https://docs.freebsd.org/doc/7.4-RELEASE/usr/share/doc/en/articles/linux-e=
mulation/article.html>
).
Maybe it might be interesting to have a look to clone alternatives ? Maybe =
`
rfork <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=3Drfork>` ?

For Windows 10, with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) singularity install
might be easier in the future. :)

Guillaume
