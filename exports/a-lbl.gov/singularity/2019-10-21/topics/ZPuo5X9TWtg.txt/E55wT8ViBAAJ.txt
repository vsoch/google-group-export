Glad to help! Another solution that I like a lot, as it integrates straight
forward into:

Version Control (Github) --> Test (Continuous Integration) --> Deploy
(Docker or Singularity Hubs)

is to use Circle/Travis CI for building! I set up a simple example with
Travis --> https://vsoch.github.io/2018/singularity-ci/, and then for
Docker on Circle CI (with their awesome workflows!) -->
https://sci-f.github.io/builder/. As you can see, it's a very general
template to build and deploy, and would be worth creating one akin to the
second (the SCIF version that does a complete workflow but uses Docker) for
Singularity containers. For both, the issue is that it's not allowed to
push to Singularity Hub. But it is allowed to push to an institution
Singularity
Registry <https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry>, *or* to any cloud
storage service (e.g., Google Storage, AWS S3). Then you can more easily
integrate the containers into whatever kind of cloud / local storage your
group uses (even with something like rclone <https://github.com/ncw/rclone>)
or for more of a manager, sregistry server client
<https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/clients>. The nice thing is
that there is flexibility to use these free, open source tools to roll your
own build --> test --> deploy!

If there is an endpoint missing there that you'd like, please let me know
and I'd be happy to add for you! If you have other cool ideas, also down to
help out :)

Best,

Vanessa

It&#39;s also the case that you can activate different branches, if you nee=
d another level of maintaining things, or build from commits, deployment, o=
r manual trigger.
<div><br>
This is the balanced solution that I came up with to allow for flexibility =
of location, and multiple builds per repository with custom tagging. It use=
d to be that you could have only one recipe, Singularity, at the base of th=
e repository. It also ensures that
 a build is completely reproducible - if Singularity Hub were to go away, y=
our tags would be represented in the original repository. With a custom ent=
ry (akin to Docker Hub) it might not be clear what tag was associated with =
what build. This is also why we
 build directly from Github repos, so that the recipes are (at least assumi=
ng the user doesn&#39;t completely delete the repo) traceable back to a rec=
ipe (vs. an image that is pushed and... who knows how it was made?)
