Justin, I'm experiencing a similar issue on a CentOS7 (7.6.1810) test host 
I am using prior to move images into our HPC cluster.  Here is what I'm 
doing: 1. YUM bootstrap CentOS6 - minimal install; 2. Run the created image:

[root@centos7 recipes]# ./CentOS6-generic.sif
FATAL:   container creation failed: mount error: can't mount image 
/proc/self/fd/8: failed to mount squashfs filesystem: no such device

I have verified the kernel modules, no squash listed... I got lost here... 
any hint?

Thanks in advance!
-Hugo
