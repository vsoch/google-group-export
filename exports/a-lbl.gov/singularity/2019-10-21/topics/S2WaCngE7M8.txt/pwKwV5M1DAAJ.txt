Is that compile check done here?

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/23bf8db023a831585f57e30659ebc0085f3bf7de/configure.ac#L141-L152

And run-time here?

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/ea2f648176d0d18dea930d379a090bba73c11c66/src/lib/privilege.c#L370-L373

So, am I correct that your reply brings back some hope for my original
question of getting Singularity to run on Centos 6.6 (and hopefully
also our RHEL 6.6 + Penguin cluster)?   Would it's possible to
configure the build explicitly so that "prctl() supports
PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS in user space" is disabled and thereby align it
which that is seen at run time?  Would that "magically" make
Singularity work? (*)

Thanks,

Henrik

(*) I obviously only understand so much of how all this work.
