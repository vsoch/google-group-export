Subject: Re: [Singularity] Kubernets with singularity
To: singularity@lbl.gov
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hi,
   The current singularity container does not virtualize
networking/CPU/memory.  It may not be easy for Kubernete to control
the resource consumption.

Also need to build network layer for singularity.
See Flannel (from Coreos) (also in RHEL 7 kubernetes) example (there
is a flow diagram there)
https://github.com/coreos/flannel

Another concern:  currently we build singularity container
independently (each one requires base images). The base image is not
shared across containers. Is it a concern when we run many services in
one machine if each service is packed in one container?

Thanks

Jianxiong
