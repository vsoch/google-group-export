Subject: Feature request:  Would like to be able to define binds in the
 container definition file.

I searched around in the group and in the documentation and it doesn't seem 
like this feature exists, but I have a situation where I have some config 
and log directories for my application that are located in the hosts /opt 
directory that I always need the container to pull in.  I would prefer to 
make it so that the user doesn't have to pass the -B option because I have 
to bring in 8 or 9 different individual directories under that tree, and I 
don't want to bring in all of /opt, nor do I want to leave the user with a 
giant string of -B options...  I also don't want to set a global config for 
these directories in the singularity.conf file because not all of the 
containers should have them.

As a side note, my users are want to run the container via running 
<./container_name> rather than singularity run -B <some>:<dirs> 
<container_name>

It would be really nice if you could provide a %bind section or something 
similar in the definition file so that the binds can be set up in a more 
automated way.

I assume that the functionality isn't there either because it wasn't 
thought of, or maybe for security reasons.  If the security thing is the 
main concern, maybe the functionality could be toggled in the main 
singularity.conf file?

Any help would be most appreciated.
