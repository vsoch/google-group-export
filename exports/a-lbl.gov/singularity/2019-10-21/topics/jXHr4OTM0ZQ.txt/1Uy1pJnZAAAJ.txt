Thomas: Well, I would say whether it is counter-intuitive that Singularity
binds the user's home directory in a sudo session is more like a personal
issue. Just want to remind that normally a user would save source codes in
one's own home (/home/$USER) even when one has root access. When one tries
to install stuffs into a container, one expects to install from home as
well (for example by issuing make install), not from /root.

David: You got my point! BTW, I work for a system provider and am actually
a user and a system administrator at the same time. We have plenty of
clusters for internal use and there we implement fine-grained sudo access
permissions. In the past I worked in a few German and Japanese universities
where I am given a workstation and remote access to a few really large HPC
clusters.

Tru: That "sudo singularity" == "sudo bash" is correct and needs to be made
clear to everyone (at least I was not aware of that in the beginning). With
your assumption that a user is root on her own workstation where an image
is built and modified, the way how Singularity behaves is all valid. I do
want to point out that such an assumption is pretty strong in that many
people simply do not get root access on their workstations (because the
workstations share some resources (NFS, printer ...) or the IT department
is worried about that a user would change some core settings which causes
troubles -- even just local -- that needs to be solved by the IT helpdesk).
This was why I thought about fine-grained sudo, which is used frequently in
these situations. However, the discussion here concluded that even such an
approach would still be inappropriate.
