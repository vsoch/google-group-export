How should the host command, being run from the container, access its libs?

I'm trying to do something very similar to Jonathan, I think.

I want to run qsub of the host (PBS scheduler) from a script within a 
container.

Using --bind, as you described, I am able to access the host qsub from 
within the container, though qsub is not able to find its libraries (ex. 
libssl.so.10 and, likely, others).

What is the best way to solve this?

--bind the dirs containing the missing libs? Would this create conflicts 
for stuff within the container?
See if the admins will containerize PBS?
try to install the missing libs within the container?
Something else?

Also, I want to run the host mpirun from scripts within my container. Is 
there a similar solution?

Background:

Our scripts do a lot of pre/post processing, setup/tear down, environment 
detection, and automate the PBS requests and MPI launching. We probably 
could un-automate the PBS request (qsub script and qsub call), though this 
would be unfortunate. We probably could not un-embed the mpirun call from 
within the script.
