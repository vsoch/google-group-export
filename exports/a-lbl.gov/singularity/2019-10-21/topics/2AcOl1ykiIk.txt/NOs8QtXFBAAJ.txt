Hi Vijay,

You should generally not make writable changes after you create the image -
how will it be reproduced? But what you can do when you are developing /
testing (and not sure how much space you will need) with Singularity 2.4 is
to use build, and specifically, into a sandbox (which is just a folder so
there is no concern about running out of space, unless your filesystem
does!)

sudo singularity build --sandbox sandbox/ Singularity


where --sandbox is the argument
sandbox/ is a folder you are going to build into
and Singularity is the build recipe

then when you are happy with your recipe, you can either build squashfs
from the finished recipe file:

sudo singularity build finished.simg Singularity


OR build it directly from the sandbox folder!

sudo singularity build finished.simg sandbox/


I would recommend building the folder first, recording down the necessary
commands, then all from scratch with squashfs. That way, someone can find
your recipe and reproduce the work.

Best,

Vanessa
