Ohh, very interesting. The problem isn't exec, the problem is that exec is
being called with an integer...

The tar file referenced on the github.io pages pulls from the 1.0 branch
instead of master. You might want to test with the 1.0 branch, but I'm not
sure it will make much of a difference. I will take a look at this and try
to debug shortly and let you know.

Thanks!
