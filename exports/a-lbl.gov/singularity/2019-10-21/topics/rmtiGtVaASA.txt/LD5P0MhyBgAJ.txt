Hi Oliver,

  Because that doesn't work for what we're requiring. We're wanting to
have an indication of the -rc# show up when you run:  singularity
--version ... so we can see what the version is from that, but not
completely break the packaging.

  So, for example:

    $ singularity --version
    2.4.6rc2-dist

  But, with things being generated how they are, that isn't possible
without a rewrite of how the version string is generated. Making the
version '2.4.6rc2' means that when rpm/dpkg etc looks at packages it
sees it like:  2.4.6 < 2.4.6rc2  ; and we don't want to purposefully
break the packaging here for RC testing. If we were to put the version
as "2.4.6-rc2" then RPM building breaks because a '-' isn't valid in
the version.

  We discussed this (for _way_ to long) today, and we ended up going
with:  2.4.5.99rc#  for the RC versioning. So a "larger then released
so far," but if you were to update to the release package it would
update instead of seeing the installed version as newer when looking
at package versions (it's an ascii string comparison). From the Debian
docs with date's in the version: For example, dpkg will consider
=E2=80=9C96May01=E2=80=9D to be greater than =E2=80=9C96Dec24=E2=80=9D.

  Since it hasn't been "released" yes then it isn't that version as of
yet and from our perspective shouldn't be numbered that. Once it gets
tagged, then that tag point it will have the version number because
that's the release of that version.

  Personally, I'm of the opinion that the testing of it should happen
from a git repo build and not a package, in which case this is all
moot because the version in that case shows up as:
[version]-[branch].[git commit]  -- From my view I can see what git
commit the build was from and what branch/tag and that's what I need
to replicate the tree, baring any local modifications, if there are
issues when testing.

-J
