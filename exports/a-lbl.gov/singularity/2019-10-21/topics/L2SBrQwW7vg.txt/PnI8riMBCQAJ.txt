Yes, please add Google nameservers to your /etc/resolv.conf:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

In summary, without using those nameservers an instance IP address on Azure
is returned when you ping singularity-hub.org (try dig singularity-hub.org
with and without those entries). My team and I have debugged this to our
fullest extent, and it's still seems to be a mystery - there is no obvious
cause by way of the whois registrations, DNS caching, or server / DNS
history. I am still working with Google and so far they have just provided
a "but it works for me here" response, and I've shown them how to reproduce
the error (try a dig with and without those entries above).

TLDR: the above is the fix to ensure using Google DNS, and I have no
insight for why the issue started or persists, and I'll post updates if
Google is ever able to provide it.
