Hi,
Interesting ideas ! Specially the building farm.

Concerning /application, I prefer the tru idea, with a chown/chgrp
modification from root with a singularity command instead of a 777
directory, even if it would be easier to set at the beginning.
BTW, perhaps user software installations can also be thinking as a nested
container or with something like a conda manager + virtualenv ?

Remy

<div>I can understand that.=C2=A0 But I think that most container are not w=
ell suited to HPC environments because they don=E2=80=99t containerize user=
 space (where HPC people work).=C2=A0 They containerize system space.=C2=A0=
 In system space there are a fixed set of known
 user ids (root, etc.) that it makes sense to freeze in an absolute sense.=
=C2=A0 You=E2=80=99re snapshotting what the vendor did.=C2=A0 The vendor is=
 always someone other than the user.=C2=A0 But for any use case, the =E2=80=
=9Cuser=E2=80=9D could be lots of different people, but I want to hand my
 environment off to them and have them use it as themselves.</div>

<div>I didn&#39;t consider the differentiation between user spaces (from th=
e kernel perspective, anything not kernel space is user space), but there i=
s value in doing that as you pointed out. So we have the &quot;system&quot;=
 space which is the non-kernel components
 of the operating system. Then we have a user&#39;s environment (e.g. $HOME=
 and scratch directories). In Singularity terms, $HOME and scratch is share=
d with the host, but (again, if I am following) you are suggesting another =
space that kind of sits between the
 two; user controlled applications that exist within a container, maybe aki=
n to a software module farm?</div>

</span><div>Yes, totally!=C2=A0 In many ways this is what differentiates th=

scribe are determined by the roles at the HPC facility, and they correspond=
 to different privilege levels. =C2=A0=E2=80=9Csystem=E2=80=9D stuff is
 typically installed by facility staff using the system package manager, bu=
t HPC users don=E2=80=99t ever really use that.=C2=A0 Users work in $HOME a=

 I can share with other users and abstract the

<div>If the application space follows the container, it doesn&#39;t violate=
 reproducibility of the container itself, but what about reproducibility of=
 creating that container (e.g. for Singularity Hub, or a build service, or =
someone that wants to leverage
 all of your work but make some minor changes to the recipe)? For me, the g=
olden nugget of reproducibility is two fold,... one is the container itself=
, but on the other hand, it is the bootstrap definition file.</div>

<div>This would allow our users to build containers the same way they curre=
ntly do on our clusters, without them having to understand any fancy filesy=
stem mounts, overlay semantics, or external build farms.=C2=A0 Coupled with=
 Spack (an entirely user-space
 package manager) they could also easily build their dependencies in the &q=
uot;myuser&quot; directory, without worrying about portability concerns tha=
t arise from differently named home directories on different systems.</div>

<div><br>

<div>I think that is a great idea! If I am understanding correctly, could a=
n example implementation look like this:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>$ singularity shell --writable ~/container.img</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; echo $PATH</div>
<div>/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:<wbr>/usr/local/bin:/applications/b<wbr>=
in</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; cd ~/git/awesomeness</div>
<div>Singularity container.img&gt; ./configure --prefix=3D/applications &am=
p;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If so, that would be pretty straight forward to implement.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>Yes! =C2=A0if /applications is always owned by &lt;whoever launched th=
