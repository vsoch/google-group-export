Hello,

could you briefly describe which are the steps we need to follow to create 
a singularity container
starting from a docker image with singularity v2? I understand that with v1 
we had to install singularity within the docker image. Is it the same with 
v2 ? How do we pass the docker contents to the singularity container? Do we 
need to create and bootstrap a new singularity container from scratch or is 
it through a particular singularity command like import or something 
similar?

Thanks,
Yiannis
