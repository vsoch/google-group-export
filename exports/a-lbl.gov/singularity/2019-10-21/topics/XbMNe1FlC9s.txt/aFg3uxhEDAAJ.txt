Does the setuid code meet Debian's standards for a releasable package?
I don't think it's releasable for Fedora, and I still need to consult on
what to do about that.

For what it's worth, I recently found the useful-looking
<https://research.cs.wisc.edu/mist/presentations/XSEDE2014-SecureProgramming.pdf>
from a reference to guidelines on writing secure code to which I assume
XSEDE applications are meant to adhere.  Maybe something from XSEDE
carries weight.  Several general points from it are addressed in the
changes under <https://github.com/loveshack/singularity/tree/2.x>.
Others aren't, like more secure file opening, which would break test.sh.

Another thing hinted at in those guidelines:  I prevented sexec building
with a non-GNU libc because it doesn't sanitize the environment, and I
couldn't see anything in musl, at least, doing the job.  It may not be
an issue in practice, since I doubt such libraries are used on
multi-access systems, but better safe than sorry.
