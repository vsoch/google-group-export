What kind of limits can you sent on an RDMA controller to set limits via
CGroups? I may have to investigate that in more details!

And, for the record, while you are completely right regarding Singularity
being able to run like any other application in a system, and thus doesn't
inherently do it's own CGroup'ing, we are also expanding our use cases
slightly to where CRgroup integration may indeed be possible, iff one is
launching Singularity as root and using the start/stop functionality. This
isn't a promise, but something being considered.

Stay tuned for another "consideration" that is being thought through for
feedback.
