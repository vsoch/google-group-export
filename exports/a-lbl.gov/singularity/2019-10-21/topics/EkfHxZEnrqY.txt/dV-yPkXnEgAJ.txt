Hello I have been trying to install firedrake 
(https://firedrakeproject.org/index.html) on a Cluster but have been having 
some problems, primarily due to being from a non-CS background. Any help is 
appreciated. 

1. I built a Docker image with firedrake installed 
(docker://bhaveshshrimali/firedrakestable2:try2Jan23) and am trying 
singularity pull <docker_image:image_tag> in order to build a singularity 
image on my computer. Firstly, when I construct the image I always see the 
installed folder (or any other folders that I created in the Docker image) 
in my root directory. 

Is there a way to avoid that ? Also, when I do singularity build 
<image_name.simg> docker://<image_name:image_tag> on my local machine, I 
get the following warning: 

       Building container as an unprivileged user. If you run this 
container as root

WARNING: it may be missing some functionality.

I used "sudo singularity build ..." to circumvent this issue. 
 
2. Secondly, I tried testing the installation and it does warn me about 
folder permissions but runs fine when I am running the container on my 
local machine (Windows 10). I am using vagrant and virtual box following 
the instructions from installation guide pretty much verbatim. 

3. But when I transfer the image (.simg file) to Cluster, and do 
singularity shell <imega_name.simg> and try to run my package, it throws 
multiple exceptions for file/folder permissions, and all the tests fail. 

While I can try to resolve the issues with my package (firedrake) at my 
end, any help on constructing a singularity image with python3 and 
firedrake installed will be appreciated. 

Thank you
Bhavesh
