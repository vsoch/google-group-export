Hi Vanessa,

Thanks for your reply. I can create the image/directory on a centos box 
where I have root access, however I would like to use the image/dir on a 
system (centos 6.8) where I do not have root privileges and where I have 
installed singularity (2.2.1) as a regular user (as installing singularity 
from root is not supported).

Do I have to install the devel version of singularity on the host where I 
do not have root access or on the host where I create the img/directory 
(and where I have root access)?

With the current singularity version 2.2.1 using the "singularity mount" 
command without sudo does not work:

$ singularity mount ubuntu.img /tmp/container/
ERROR: Calling user must be root!

nor does:

$ singularity shell /tmp/ubuntu/
ERROR  : Failed invoking the NEWUSER namespace runtime: Invalid argument
ABORT  : Retval = 255

where:

$ ls /tmp/ubuntu/
ubuntu.img

or (as expected):

$ singularity shell /tmp/ubuntu/
ERROR  : Failed invoking the NEWUSER namespace runtime: Invalid argument
ABORT  : Retval = 255


Any chances that I can get singularity (installed by my regular user) to 
load an image (created elsewhere) on the centos 6.8 box where I do not have 
root access?

Thanks,

rd
