I'm also in favor of keeping a writable options. One of the things we do
with Singularity is build a dev container in which we get code
built/installed/running to test; we then make debs or rpms of the working
apps and install those during bootstrap of the 'production' containers.
Sure, we could fire up VMs of every distribution that we'd like to use
inside of our containers, but frankly the writability of the SIngularity
container makes this process much less administratively messy.
