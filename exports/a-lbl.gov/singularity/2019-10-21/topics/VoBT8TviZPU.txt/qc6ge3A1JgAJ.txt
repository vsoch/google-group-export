Thanks for the replies.

We'd prefer to 'singularity install app .sapp' into the centralized cache 
for serial and omp apps as well as ompi apps and just keep it there, 
especially for diskless nodes. The extra few seconds of startup time 
because of reading from a networked filesystem are not an issue since apps 
are started and run for hours to weeks at a time anyway.

Thanks for the 'SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR' hint!

I'm looking forward to gmk* responding to the locking question.

Best wishes,

Alex
