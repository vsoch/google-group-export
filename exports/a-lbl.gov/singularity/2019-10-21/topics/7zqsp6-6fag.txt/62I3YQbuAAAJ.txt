Hey Vanessa,

Don't worry, they will get reviewed.  You've probably noticed that we are
working hard on the squashfs feature branch right now.  After that gets
merged into development I'm sure gmk will start looking over PRs again.  If
you really want, you could always work out of that feature branch and send
your PRs there, but I think it will be merged soon.

Hey MC,

SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT is actually a variable that can be used during
%post.  You can echo env vars there during your %post section.  Let's say
for instance that you don't know what the value of some env var until after
you install some package or create some hash or some such thing.  You can
use this mechanism instead of echoing directly to /environment (which V
somehow thinks is the devil =;^P )

See this PR for more info.
