Hi Eliot,=20

Thanks for giving it a test, thats promising at least.=20

Ah, of course, I hadn't really considered what is actually inside an image=

before you said that. Sounds like I will have to convince the admins to=20
give me access to a machine to test building images on.=20

Appreciate the info

    <div>Hi Adrian,<br>
      <br>
      We&#39;re not using it in production yet, but I just did a quick test
      on one of our OpenPOWER systems and Singularity looks to work ok.<br>
      <br>
      HOWEVER, your existing images (built for x86) are all made up of
      CPU instructions for x86 CPUs. You will need to build new images
      on a POWER system (compiling all the binaries for POWER8 CPUs). If
      you&#39;re lucky, your existing bootstrap definition files will get
      you most of the way there. If your definition files reference
      existing Docker images or binary files which were built for x86,
      there will be more effort.<br>

        <div>We will soon be getting access to a new cluster which is
          being built with IBM POWER8 architecture. Having used
          Singularity for a little while on our current x86 HPC, I was
          hoping we could get Singularity installed on the new POWER
