<br>
Remy&#39;s not right about the warning; in your case, it is indeed<br>
/etc/localtime causing the warning, not --nv.=C2=A0 That&#39;s just another=
 case<br>
that can cause the warning.<br>
<br>
The problem is that in order for underlay to add a bind mount point<br>
inside a big directory such as /etc, it has to also bind mount every<br>
other file in the directory from the original image.=C2=A0 That may or may<=
br>
not be a problem, but that&#39;s why there&#39;s a warning.=C2=A0 I haven&#=

problems caused by a large number of bind mount points when testing as a<br=

single user on one machine, but I don&#39;t know if there might be limits<b=

with many containers running on a large many-core system.=C2=A0 I also don&=

know how it affects performance, but it is reasonable to think that it<br>
has some impact.<br>
<br>
You can avoid the warning by including an /etc/localtime bind mount<br>
point inside the image, if you have control over that.=C2=A0 There&#39;s al=
so a<br>
singularity -s option to silence all warnings.=C2=A0 There&#39;s not curren=

any parameter to change the warning point; I didn&#39;t think that was wort=
