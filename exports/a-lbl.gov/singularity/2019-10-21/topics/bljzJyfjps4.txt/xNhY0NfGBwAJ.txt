Hello there, first post on the group.  We are new with Singularity and we 
have identified this as an option for a CentOS6-to-7 migration.   We have 
one of our workflows with a hard-coded sudo call to run an application (a 
typical situation where you have legacy software nobody is maintaining 
anymore...).  When we try to run this workflow on the container we get the 
error:

sudo: effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root?

Yes, *we are aware there is no user privilege escalation for Singularity 
containers*, however, I have to ask the question if there is any 
*workaround* the problem we are trying to solve by using Singularity.

Help appreciated!

Thanks,
-Hugo
