Yes I would think that is possible as everything that isn't in C is in shel=
l (easy way to remain truly portable on all POSIX systems). Most of the bui=
lding is thus in shell.

But why not just install Singularity into the Docker? If it is distributed =
via RPM and DEB should be pretty straight forward? Or have several distribu=
tion overlays available to be installed via a dockerfile?=20

Thanks!
