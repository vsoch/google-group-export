Hi Thomas,

Thanks for your help. Your idea seems good. I actually tried and it could 
be a solution. However, first of all, I have realized my first assumption 
was wrong because even if singularity loads my bashrc it also uses the 
environment variables that were already set from the shell that I'm working 
on. This can be solved by unseting the variables from the bashrc if I 
detect I'm starting a singularity shell.  But apparently singularity exec 
does not load my bashrc before executing. Therefore, I still need to find a 
solution when I'm not working in the singularity shell but executing just 
an script through singularity. 
Do you know why singularity is not loading the bashrc when using the option 
'exec' ? I thought singularity exec was a shortcut to avoid doing 
singularity shell and then the call to the script.
Regards,

oriol
