Hey David!

I think you might be hitting an issue that has since been fixed but not
released (and thus not running with the Shub builders.) It's likely about
an empty layer or hitting zeros, something like -->
https://serverfault.com/questions/31751/how-can-i-extract-from-this-tar-file-when-my-file-may-be-corrupt.
The Dave's can comment about which PR fixed it, maybe one around this time?
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/1261

We can confirm that the current (updated) command in 2.4 that uses the
docker-extract script, here -->
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/release-2.4/libexec/handlers/image-docker.sh#L44
is different than the last release version on Singularity Hub. So - I think
once the builders are updated with the new release the issue should be
resolved. It's a silly extraction issue, is what it comes down to!

Best,

Vanessa
