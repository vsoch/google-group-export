Exploring Singularity 2.4.2 as a normal user I've built a sandbox container 
with CentOS 6.
Now I want to delete this container, but I don't have permission to do so 
because it's owned by root:

$ ls -lad centos6.BAK
dr-xr-xr-x. 22 root root 4096 Jan 30 11:17 centos6.BAK

What I seem to be missing is functionality like:

sudo singularity delete centos6.BAK

Alas, it seems that this is not possible.

Question: How may a normal user delete a container owned by root?

Thanks,
Ole
