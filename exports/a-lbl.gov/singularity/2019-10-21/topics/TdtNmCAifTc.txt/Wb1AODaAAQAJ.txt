Hi,

I am trying to push my container to Singularity-Hub and make it available 
to everyone. Followed the steps successfully and the build shows "Competed 
Successfully".

Now I would like to test pulling out and execute the code within.

There are 2 issues:

1. I am unable to see the container listed under all collections and can't 
get to it through search as well
2. When trying to pull directly from my machine, I see the following error 
WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images 
will succeed
FATAL:   Failed to get manifest from Shub: The requested manifest was not 
found in singularity hub

Also tried to pull the hello world container to test:

singularity pull shub://vsoch/singularity-hello-world
But getting the same error about failing to get manifest.. 

The name of my collection is rkpandya/CERR
Appreciate your help!

Thanks,
Rutu
