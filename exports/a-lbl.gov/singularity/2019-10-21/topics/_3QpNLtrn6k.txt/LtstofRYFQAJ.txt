Hrmm... Then you'd want to change that like:

mkdir -p /usr/local/cuda/compat
chmod 1777 /usr/local/cuda/compat

In my cuda install, I don't have a "compat" directory. The `-p`
option, will make parent directories if they don't exists, and has the
side effect of not erroring if the directory you're trying to create
already exists.
