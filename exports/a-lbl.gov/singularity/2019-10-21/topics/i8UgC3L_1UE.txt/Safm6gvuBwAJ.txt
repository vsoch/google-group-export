Yep, I forgot about resize2fs because I never use it. lol

Considering that... There exists a helper binary in the libexec dir which
can be used for binding the image to a loop (automatically figured out the
offset of the image) and binds to the next available loop device. Then you
can use resize2fs directly on that loop device, and then unbind it. This
would be easy enough to wrap a CLI module (singularity subcommand) around
this process. Anyone want to take a stab at that?

Good thinking Reid!
