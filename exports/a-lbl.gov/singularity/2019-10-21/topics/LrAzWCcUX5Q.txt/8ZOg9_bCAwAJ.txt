Yes, the portable app problem will come into play here.  If everything can
install to the prefix cleanly, then it can be built in stage 1 and
recursively copied into stage 2 with:
%files from stage_1
     /opt/vim_8.1 /opt

If things need to be installed in system directories, then you might be
able to copy the build directory into stage 2 and do the 'make install'
from there.
