There are two kinds of security checks I think about - a constant scanner
(usually requiring a server) and then "on demand) (eg, like a security
linter when an image is built / used, etc)

*Scanner*
David has been working on a Clair (security scanner) to go alongside
Singularity Registry.

https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues/14

I'm not sure about the status, but it would be great to get this working
for some kind of optional plugin.

*Checks*
This, along with "on demand" checks:

https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/development/libexec/hel=
pers#checks

It would be great to expand the checks that are provided with Singularity -
right now they are mostly basic / examples with hope that the community can
contribute!
