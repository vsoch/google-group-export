Subject: Re: [Singularity] Error running or building sandbox with Singularity
 when it's installed as a user

Hi Samy,

Running singularity unprivileged means it cannot mount a container image.
This means you cannot build a container image, only a sandbox - but also
Singularity cannot mount an existing image to extract to a sandbox (as you
are trying to do, since shub:// serves images).

You would be able to build a sandbox from a docker:// uri as docker
containers come down as .tar.gz files which can be extracted as a user.

DT
