Dear Singularity-experts,

here's the next follow-up... 

OpenSSH has included a workaround for this matter since pretty recently:
https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=d13281f2964abc5f2e535e1613c77fc61b0c53e7
In older releases, it's possible to specify the "UsePrivilegeSeparation no" option (which is [to be] removed in newer releases) for the sshd started inside the container (which runs with user privileges in any case)
to trigger an unaffected code-path for usage in HTCondor interactive jobs. 

While this resolves the problem at hand, it still means it seems to be impossible to have something "root-owned" inside a user-namespaced container - is this correct? 

Also, sadly, for some reason, https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/857 came up again once I enabled user namespaces (or rather, disabled SUID and OverlayFS),
and I ran into fresh SELinux issues which I am still investigating. 

All this makes me wonder: Is anybody using Singularity with HTCondor successfully? Are all those sites giving up on interactive jobs,
or using SUID mode in combination with the other hacks I already had to develop (special bind mounts etc.)? 
If so, how do they provide their users with a "compile environment" (the easiest solution for that, IMHO, would be to just let them use an interactive job redirected into a container)? 

It would be nice to collect and share some experiences on this, since HTCondor is one of the most widespread batch systems in HPC and HTC, and for sure one of the main environments
Singularity is target at (I guess). 

Cheers and thanks in advance for any feedback,
	Oliver
