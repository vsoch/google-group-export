Thanks Dave,

My thought was more to deal with these sort of "single user" images created
in docker land, specifically. If there is just a single user of interest
that we want to map onto the host user running singularity, then I guess it
might be possible to deal with this down the road, if not now.

I guess, for now, I will just have to build my base image completely
separately in Docker and Singularity, and see how that goes - it is fine, I
just wanted to check if there was a more clever way to go about  it.
