Subject: Bug found in v2.1 - container locking
To: singularity <singu...@lbl.gov>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a11407c568766870538cb8f98

There was a bug reported by Kilian here:

https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity/issues/174

If you have the container file on an NFS file system *and* have
local_lock=none (default) Singularity will fail to obtain the flock on the
image and bail out.

Workarounds include moving the container to a different file system, or use
one of the other local_lock options for your NFS mount.

The long term fix will be released next week'ish (as 2.1.1) and will
include a configuration file parameter fix to avoid all locking by
disabling an image from being writable (possibly only for non-root users).

Thanks!
