Update: The best way turned out to be using the following:

Bootstrap: docker
From: nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04

Then installing python3.5, python virtualenv, tensorflow  and the 
dependencies. 

Thank you all for your help!

Hi Marty,<br>
<br>
Yes I am using Vagrant. Attached is the screen. I can&#39;t tab or use up a=
nd down arrow keyes or anything else to get to OK to continue the process.<=

There shouldn&#39;t be any dialog box that pops up when building the contai=
ner from the definition file.=C2=A0Are you using a Linux virtual machine (e=
.g., running on Virtual Box) to use Singularity? Maybe you can send us some=
 screenshots showing the issue?<br>

Hi Marty, I actually tried that first - but in the process a dialogue box c=
omes that requires me to click/select &quot;OK&quot;, but they keyes on my =
keyboard are not mapped to the display it seems and I am not able to procee=
d from here. <br>
<br>
I tried a few other recipes as well from Singularity Hub, haven&#39;t yet b=
een able to successfully build a container that has Tensorflow 1.12.0, cuda=
 9 and cudnn 7 and has also has git. :(<br>

And as I mentioned previously, if you need to build a custom container for =
your work, have a look at our definition file [1]. We build TensorFlow with=
 GPU support from source for both python2 and python3.=C2=A0<br>

It looks like you are pointing at a non-existent repository or mirror for t=
he software.=C2=A0 The error reports that the files are not at <br>
the URL you are pointing at.<br>

I am not a ubuntu person but rather centos but you should be able to point =

I&#39;m not sure - I&#39;d guess it&#39;s the latest in development (1.13.1=

pip install tensorflow=3D=3D1.12.0<br>
